    "DOCUMENT1 = \"Rice cultivation is well-suited to countries and regions with low labor costs and high rainfall, as it is labor-intensive to cultivate and requires ample water. The traditional method for cultivating rice is flooding the fields while, or after, setting the young seedlings. This simple method requires sound planning and servicing of the water damming and channeling, but reduces the growth of less robust weed and pest plants that have no submerged growth state. While flooding is not mandatory for the cultivation of rice, all other methods of irrigation require higher effort in weed and pest control during growth periods and a different approach for fertilizing the soil.  Nutrient ManagementImportance of NutrientsNutritional DisordersManuring Fertilizer Requirement INM Nutrient ManagementImportance of NutrientsPaddy requires the following essential nutrients for its normal development:CarbonNitrogenCalciumHydrogenPhosphorusMagnesiumOxygenPotassiumSulphurIronZincChlorineManganeseBoronCopperMolybdenumNitrogen, phosphorus and potassium are known as primary plant nutrients; calcium, magnesium and sulphur, as secondary nutrients; iron manganese, copper, zinc, boron, molybdenum and chlorine as trace elements or micro-nutrients. The primary and secondary nutrient elements are known as major elements. This classification is based on their relative abundance, and not on their relative importance. The micronutrients are required in small quantities, but they are important as the major elements in plant nutrition.Nitrogen Nitrogen, the most important nutrient for rice, is universally limiting the rice productivity.Nitrogen encourages the vegetative development of plants by imparting a healthy green color to the leaves.It seems that majority of Indica varieties are adapted to relatively low levels of nitrogen in the region of 25 kg N/ha.Rice plant depends mainly for its nitrogen upon the decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions and in the early stages of growth takes up nitrogen in the form of ammonia which is the stable form of nitrogen in submerged soils.There are two stages in the growth of rice crop when nitrogen is most needed; early vegetative and panicle initiation stages.Fertilizing the crop during early vegetative growth promotes tillering leading to higher yield. Application at panicle initiation or early booting stage will help the plant produce more and heavier grains per panicle.PhosphorusPhosphorus is particularly important in early growth stages.It is mobile within the plant and promotes root development (Particularly the development of fibrous roots),tillering and early flowering.Addition of mineral P fertilizer is required when the rice plants root system is not yet fully developed and the native soil P supply is inadequate.Phosphorus is remobilized within the plant during later growth stages if sufficient P has been absorbed during early growth.It also increases resistance to disease and strengthens the stems of cereal plants, thus reducing their tendency to lodge. It offsets the harmful effects of excess nitrogen in the plant.PotassiumPotassium enhances the ability of the plants to resist diseases, insect attacks, cold and other adverse conditions.It plays an essential part in the formation of starch and in the production and translocation of sugars, and is thus of special value to carbohydrate-rich crops.Involves in working of enzymes.Helps in production and movement of photosynthates to sink.Helps in proper uptake of other nutrients.Influences tillering or branching of plant and size and weight of grain.Over 80 per cent of the absorbed potassium by the plant is found in straw.Need for potassium is most likely to occur on sandy soils.CalciumCalcium combines with pectin in the plant to form calcium pectate, which is an essential constituent of the cell-wall.It also promotes the activity of soil bacteria concerned with the fixation of free nitrogen or the formation of nitrates from organic forms of nitrogen.Furthermore, it is necessary for the development of a good root system. MagnesiumMagnesium is an essential constituent of chlorophyll.It is usually needed by plant in relatively small quantities.Hence its deficiency in the soil is experienced later than that of potassium.SulphurIt involve in chlorophyll production, protein synthesis and plant function and structure. Sulphur forms an important constituent of straw and plant stalks.IronIron is necessary for the synthesis of chlorophyll. Mainly a problem in upland soils. ZincEssential for the transformation of carbohydrates. Regulates consumption of sugars. The function of zinc in plants is as a metal activator of enzymes. Deficiency of zinc in lowland rice occurs in near neural to alkaline soils, particularly in calcareous soils. Availability of both soil and applied zinc is higher in upland soil than in submerged soil. Soil submergence causes decrease in zinc concentration in the soil solution. Rice crop removes 30-40 g Zn per tonne of grain.BoronBoron facilitates the translocation of sugars by forming sugar borate complex. It involves in cell differentiation and development since boron is essential for DNA synthesis. Also involves in fertilization, hormone metabolism etc. CopperIt is an important constituent of plastocyanin (copper containing protein).\"\n",
    "DOCUMENT2 = \"Systems of rice cultivation in various rice growing areas are largely depends upon the crop growing conditions like soil type, available water and prevailing monsoon. The principal rice ecosystems followed in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Karnataka are: 1.Wet system 2.Dry system 3.Semidry system Wet System Paddy Root The wet system is also known as Irrigated rice. The rice variety Padma cannot be grown together with Bala. In this system, the crop is grown under wet (irrigated) conditions from seed to seed. The field is brought to a soft puddle by repeated ploughings with 5-7 cm standing water. After obtaining a soft puddle and perfect levelling, rice seedlings are transplanted or sprouted seeds dibbled or broadcasted on the puddle field. This system of cultivation is followed wherever assured irrigation water is available. This irrigated rice contributes to 55 per cent of the total rice production System of Rice Intensification (SRI) Transplanted Puddled Lowland Rice Direct Wet Seeded Puddled Lowland Rice METHODS FOLLOWED IN WET SYSTEM ARE SYSTEM OF RICE INTENSIFICATION TRANSPLANTED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE DIRECT WET SEEDED PUDDLED LOWLAND RICE Top System of Rice Intensification System of Rice Intensification (SRI) is a methodology for increasing the productivity of irrigated rice by changing the management of plants, soil, water and nutrients particularly by eliciting greater root growth. SRI is not a technology because something still evolving and improving, season by season, as more experience is gained and as more farmers, scientists and others apply their intelligence and insights to making rice production more efficient and sustainable. Critical Steps in SRI SRI Practices Advantages and Constraints of SRI Crop Response Difference between Conventional and SRI method of cultivation Cost comparison for Conventional and SRI method of cultivation Critical steps in SRI Nursery area and Seed rate Seedling age Square planting Water management Mechanical (Cono) weeder usage Nursery area and seed rate Only 7-8 kg of seed is required to plant 1 ha. Nursery area is reduced to 100m2 / ha. For raised beds @ 1 x 5 m and 20 beds are required for 1 ha. Spread polythene sheets over the beds evenly. Fill the soil evenly over the Polythene sheets upto 4cm. Uniformly spread 375 g of seeds in each 5 sq.m. nursery bed. Watering through rose can is advisable. Cover the seed bed using locally available mulching materials like coirpith/straw nurseryarea Seedling age seedlingage Fourteen days old seedlings were recommended for transplanting (3 leaves stage) If the nursery bed is properly prepared with sufficient organic manure, the seedling growth will be good to handle. Water Management Water management is one of the critical steps in SRI and provision of aerobic environment in rice fields is the core point in SRI. Plants with truncated roots cannot access the residual soil moisture in lower horizons that is accessible to plants which have large and functioning roots systems to maintain their growth and productivity. Hence, alternate wetting and drying is advocated. Irrigation only to moist the soil in the early period of 10 days. Restoring irrigation to a maximum depth of 2.5cm after development of hairline cracks in the soil until panicle initiation. Increasing irrigation depth to 5.0 cm after Panicle initiation one day after disappearance of ponded water. watermgmt Mechanical (Cono) weeder usage mech8 Square planting eases the cono/rotary weeder operation in two directions, and thereby weed management could be effected efficiently. In SRI, weeder should be used at 10 days interval from the date of transplanting. Three labours are enough to weed one acre. Weeds are trampled and on decay the nutrient are ploughed back to the soil. Soil is frequently disturbed which has beneficial physico chemical – biological results in soil. Root pruning triggers the tillering that results in bursting out of tillers. Water level should be properly monitored for usage of weeder. It is important to remove the left out weeds by hand. By this the cost of weeding is reduced by 52.5%. Top SRI Practices The Principles of SRI are achieved by following certain practices Season Dry season with assured irrigation is more suitable. Difficulty in crop establishment may be seen in areas with heavy downpour (NE Monsoon periods of Tamil Nadu) Varieties Hybrids and varieties with heavy tillering. Seed rate 7- 8 kg / ha for single seedling per hill Nursery Management Required nursery area is 100 m2/ha (or) 2.5 cent/ha – 1cent/acre Usage of well decomposed good quality FYM judiciously. For raised beds @ 1 x 5 m and 20 beds are required for 1 ha. Powdered DAP may be applied @ 95g/raised bed in total 1.9 kg should be used. Spread polythene sheets over the beds evenly. Old polysacks can also be used. ill the soil evenly on the Polythene sheets upto 4cm. Seed treatment can be done with Pseudomonas 10g/kg seed. 75 g Azophos biofertiliser/kg seed. Uniformly spread 375 g of seeds in each 5 sq.m. nursery bed. Watering through rose can is advisable. Cover the seed bed using locally available mulching materials like coirpith/straw. Main field preparation Plough the land during summer to economize the water requirement for initial preparation of land. Flood the field 1 or 2 days before ploughing and allow water to soak in. Keep the surface of the field covered with water. Keep water to a depth of 2.5cm at the time of puddling. Good leveling (laser leveling) of the main field is essential in SRI. Field drainage is an important component in SRI. Transplanting The seedling along with the soil intact with the roots should be removed and plant them immediately. Fourteen days old seedlings were recommended for transplanting. At this stage the seedling will have 3 leaves. If the nursery bed is properly prepared with sufficient organic manure, the seedling growth will be good to handle. Plant spacing Square planting at 25 x 25cm ensures optimum space for efficient utilization of resources. Place single seedling at intersecting points marked with the marker. Place the seedling without plunging too deep into the soil. Nutirent Management Apply 12.5 t of FYM or compost or green leaf manure @ 6.25 t/ha. Organic manures addition is recommended in SRI cultivation, as they are found to supply essential nutrients, and creates favorable conditions for soil microbes being a source of carbon. Apply fertilizer nutrients as per soil test recommendations. N dose may be through Leaf Color Chart (LCC). P & K may be through Site Specific Nutrition Management. Depending on the necessity, top dress with chemical fertilizers. Water Management Water management is one of the critical steps in SRI and provision of aerobic environment in rice fields is the core point in SRI. Irrigate to 2.5 cm depth of water level after hairline crack formation up to panicle initiation and after that disappearance of ponded water. Water saving in this system is 40-50% from planting to harvest. Farmers using ground water will realize the water, time and electricity saving. Regular water application to keep soil moist but not saturated. Intermittent wetting and drying for adequate aeration during vegetative phase. Relatively frequent watering after vegetative phase. No water stagnation at any stage. Weeder Use Using weeder is of primary importance in SRI. Use simple rotary weeder between crop rows in both the directions starting from 10 days after planting About four rotary weedings at 10 to 15 days interval could be adequate till panicle initiation If necessary, one or two hand weedings may be necessary to remove weeds closer to rice plants.\"                                                                                                                                                                                    \n",

    "DOCUMENT4 = \"How inorganic fertilizers differ from bio-fertilizers? Chemical fertilizers are manufactured artificially. They are primarily, chemicals having nitrogen, phosphate and potash as main soil nutrients. Bio-fertilizers are plants such as bacteria (azotobacter, rhizobium etc.), fungi etc. that fix free nitrogen from the atmosphere, which is then 'used by the crops. Are inorganic fertilizers harmful for crops, if used in excess quantity or in wrong combination of nutrients? Yes, higher doses of chemical fertilizers can be harmful to crops. Use of wrong combination of nutrients would certainly not result in the best possible yield. Besides, sometimes even longer use of wrong combination of nutrients may harm the crops. What is meant by balanced fertilization? The requirement of nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphate and Potash are soil and crop specific. The use of right ratio of nutrients as per soil or crop requirement is known as balanced fertilization. How can I calculate the dose of fertilizer for any crop? The dose depends on the crop and soil nutrient status. For further details contact your research stations/ KVKs/ Agricultural Officers. Is there any expiry date of fertilizers? There is no expiry date for chemical fertilizers. However, in case of imported Fertilizers, the container (bag) has indication regarding month and year of Manufacture/import. What is Fertilizer Control Order? Fertilizer (Control) Order, 1985 which is administered by Department of Agriculture Cooperation, Govt. of India has been issued under the Essential Commodities Act, 1955. The FCO lays, down as to what substances qualify for use as fertilizers in the soil, product-wise specifications, methods for sampling and analysis of fertilizers, procedure for obtaining license/registration as manufacture/dealer in fertilizers and conditions to be fulfilled for trading thereof, etc. How can I take dealer license for trading in fertilizers? The procedural requirements are detailed in Clause 8 of FCO. Application has to be made in Form A/ Al to Controller of Fertilizers of the concerned State/UT for obtaining registration/license as Industrial Dealer in fertilizers or dealer in fertilizers for agricultural sales, respectively, along with fee prescribed under Clause 36 and certificate of source in Form O. What is the selling price of fertilizers? Urea is the only fertilizer with statutorily controlled price & movement. the Concession Scheme on sale of phosphatic & potassic (P&K) fertilizers provides for indicative Maximum Retail Price declared by Department of Fertilizers at which these fertilizers are to be sold. MRP for Single Super Phosphate under the Scheme is declared by the respective State/UT Government. These MRPs can be viewed on this site. Why Government is giving subsidy on fertilizers? The Government is subsidising fertiJizers for their availability at reasonable prices for agricultural purposes. This also helps in achieving the objective of balanced use of fertilizers as disparity in prices gets minimised. The system also indirectly su'pports survival of indigenous fertilizer industry moving the country further towards becoming self sufficient in meeting its requirement. Why subsidy is not given directly to farmers? The main objective of the Government is to make available fertilizers at reasonable/affordable prices for agricultural purposes including farmers. This objective is achieved through fixation of statutorily backed uniform MRP for urea and indicative MRP for fertilizers covered under the Concession Scheme on sale of decontrolled P&K fertilizers. Administratively, it is not feasible to disburse subsidy directly to farmers, which would require disbursement at the time of each. purchase and the extent thereof would depend upon the quantity and type of product purchased. Also, in such a scenario, Govt. will have to lift the price control, whether statutory or indicative, as for urea and decontrolled P&K fertilizers, respectively. Then, it would be the market forces that would control the selling price for each product, which could be manufacturer specific as well. This could lead to disparity in actual to be borne by farmers in different regions of the country. What is the difference between the Concession Scheme and Subsidy Scheme? Urea is the only fertilizer at present with pricing and distribution being controlled statutorily by the Government. Thus, no one can sell urea above the MRP declared by the Govt. Under the Concession Scheme, the MRP for each fertilizer is indicative in nature. The manufacturers/ importers of such P&K fertilizers have to sell these at the indicative MRPs declared under the Scheme in order to meet one of themandatory conditions for being eligible to claim thereunder. While subsidy on urea is paid on dispatch concession under the Scheme is paid on the quantities sold. Whether subsidy is payable to fertilizer mixture manufacturers? No subsidy is payable on mixture fertilizers. However, subsidy is paid on urea and decontrolled P&K fertilizers covered under the Concession Scheme if sold to the manufacturers of mixture fertilizers registered under FCO. How can I import and trade DAP and MOP in the country? There is no restriction on import of DAP/MOP. For trading of DAP/MOP as fertilizers in the country, the concerned importer shall. have to obtain licence/registration under FCQ from the States/UTs where the importer proposes to sell the same. For purposes of claiming concession under the Concession Scheme, the importer shall have to . approach Deptt. of Fertilizers for being enlisted as an importer in terms of guidelines on Concession Scheme issued on 5.8.2002. Can I get subsidy just after import of DAP/MOP? No, the concession is payable on sale of decontrolled P&K fertilizers including imported DAP/MOP. For the purposes of claiming concession, enlistment with DOF as an importer under the Concession Scheme is a pre-condition. The procedure for claiming payment of concession is detailed in the guidelines of 5.8.2002 on Concession Scheme. How quality control is ensured for fertilizers? The FCO has laid down fertilizer-wise detailed specifications and no fertilizer, not meeting the said specification, can be sold in the country for agricultural purposes. It also lays down detailed procedure for sampling and analysis of each fertilizer. The Central Fertilizer Quality Control & Training Institute CFQC&TI), Faridabad and its four Regional Fertilizer Control Laboratories (RFCL) under the Department of Agriculture & Co-operation (DAC) take samples of imported fertilizers at the discharge port for analysis thereof. The States also have their own State notified quality control laboratories that analyse samples taken from field (warehouses/dealers/retailers) as well as from the manufacturing plants. Based on the analysis, the labs declare samples as standard or non-standard in terms of specifications laid down in the FCO. The sub-standard quantities are arrived at as per procedure laid down in the FCO and the copies of analysis report are sent to DAC, DOF, the concerned manufacturer/importer etc. No subsidy is payable on quantities declared as sub-standard. Why the States certifies sales of decontrolled fertilizers? Concession on decontrolled P&K fertilizers is payable only on the quantities sold for agricultural purposes. Sales can be ascertained or verified from the outlet sources namely dealers/retailers and wholesalers registered under FCO. The States already have administrative field machinery for supervision and implementation of Central and State Schemes, as also ensuring compliance of provisions of FCO.\"\n",
    "DOCUMENT5 = \"Agriculture encompasses crop and livestock production, aquaculture, fisheries and forestry for food and non-food products.[1] Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that enabled people to live in cities. While humans started gathering grains at least 105,000 years ago, nascent farmers only began planting them around 11,500 years ago. Sheep, goats, pigs and cattle were domesticated around 10,000 years ago. Plants were independently cultivated in at least 11 regions of the world. In the twentieth century, industrial agriculture based on large-scale monocultures came to dominate agricultural output. Today, small farms produce about a third of the world's food, but large farms are prevalent.[2] The largest one percent of farms in the world are greater than 50 hectares and operate more than 70 percent of the world's farmland.[2] Nearly 40 percent of agricultural land is found on farms larger than 1,000 hectares.[2] However, five of every six farms in the world consist of less than two hectares and take up only around 12 percent of all agricultural land.[2] The major agricultural products can be broadly grouped into foods, fibers, fuels, and raw materials (such as rubber). Food classes include cereals (grains), vegetables, fruits, cooking oils, meat, milk, eggs, and fungi. Global agricultural production amounts to approximately 11 billion tonnes of food,[3] 32 million tonnes of natural fibres[4] and 4 billion m3 of wood.[5] However, around 14 percent of the world's food is lost from production before reaching the retail level.[6] Modern agronomy, plant breeding, agrochemicals such as pesticides and fertilizers, and technological developments have sharply increased crop yields, but also contributed to ecological and environmental damage. Selective breeding and modern practices in animal husbandry have similarly increased the output of meat, but have raised concerns about animal welfare and environmental damage. Environmental issues include contributions to climate change, depletion of aquifers, deforestation, antibiotic resistance, and other agricultural pollution. Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation, and climate change, all of which can cause decreases in crop yield. Genetically modified organisms are widely used, although some countries ban them. Etymology and scope Further information: Horticulture § Scope The word agriculture is a late Middle English adaptation of Latin agricultūra, from ager 'field' and cultūra 'cultivation' or 'growing'.[7] While agriculture usually refers to human activities, certain species of ant,[8][9] termite and beetle have been cultivating crops for up to 60 million years.[10] Agriculture is defined with varying scopes, in its broadest sense using natural resources to produce commodities which maintain life, including food, fiber, forest products, horticultural crops, and their related services.[11] Thus defined, it includes arable farming, horticulture, animal husbandry and forestry, but horticulture and forestry are in practice often excluded.[11] It may also be broadly decomposed into plant agriculture, which concerns the cultivation of useful plants,[12] and animal agriculture, the production of agricultural animals.[13] History Centres of origin, as numbered by Nikolai Vavilov in the 1930s. Area 3 is no longer recognised as a centre of origin New Guinea (area P) was identified more recently. [14][15] Main article: History of agriculture Origins Main article: Neolithic Revolution The development of agriculture enabled the human population to grow many times larger than could be sustained by hunting and gathering.[16] Agriculture began independently in different parts of the globe,[17] and included a diverse range of taxa, in at least 11 separate centers of origin.[14] Wild grains were collected and eaten from at least 105,000 years ago.[18] In the Paleolithic Levant, 23,000 years ago, cereals cultivation of emmer, barley, and oats has been observed near the sea of Galilee.[19][20] Rice was domesticated in China between 11,500 and 6,200 BC with the earliest known cultivation from 5,700 BC,[21] followed by mung, soy and azuki beans. Sheep were domesticated in Mesopotamia between 13,000 and 11,000 years ago.[22] Cattle were domesticated from the wild aurochs in the areas of modern Turkey and Pakistan some 10,500 years ago.[23] Pig production emerged in Eurasia, including Europe, East Asia and Southwest Asia,[24] where wild boar were first domesticated about 10,500 years ago.[25] In the Andes of South America, the potato was domesticated between 10,000 and 7,000 years ago, along with beans, coca, llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs. Sugarcane and some root vegetables were domesticated in New Guinea around 9,000 years ago. Sorghum was domesticated in the Sahel region of Africa by 7,000 years ago. Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 5,600 years ago,[26] and was independently domesticated in Eurasia. In Mesoamerica, wild teosinte was bred into maize by 6,000 years ago.[27] The horse was domesticated in the Eurasian Steppes around 3500 BC.[28] Scholars have offered multiple hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture. Studies of the transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural societies indicate an initial period of intensification and increasing sedentism; examples are the Natufian culture in the Levant, and the Early Chinese Neolithic in China. Then, wild stands that had previously been harvested started to be planted, and gradually came to be domesticated.[29][30][31] Civilizations Map of the world showing approximate centers of origin of agriculture and its spread in prehistory.[32] DNA studies have shown that agriculture was introduced in Europe by the expansion of the early farmers from Anatolia about 9,000 years ago. [33] In Eurasia, the Sumerians started to live in villages from about 8,000 BC, relying on the Tigris and Euphrates rivers and a canal system for irrigation. Ploughs appear in pictographs around 3,000 BC; seed-ploughs around 2,300 BC. Farmers grew wheat, barley, vegetables such as lentils and onions, and fruits including dates, grapes, and figs.[34] Ancient Egyptian agriculture relied on the Nile River and its seasonal flooding. Farming started in the predynastic period at the end of the Paleolithic, after 10,000 BC. Staple food crops were grains such as wheat and barley, alongside industrial crops such as flax and papyrus.[35][36] In India, wheat, barley and jujube were domesticated by 9,000 BC, soon followed by sheep and goats.[37] Cattle, sheep and goats were domesticated in Mehrgarh culture by 8,000–6,000 BC.[38][39][40] Cotton was cultivated by the 5th–4th millennium BC.[41] Archeological evidence indicates an animal-drawn plough from 2,500 BC in the Indus Valley civilisation.[42] In China, from the 5th century BC there was a nationwide granary system and widespread silk farming.[43] Water-powered grain mills were in use by the 1st century BC,[44] followed by irrigation.[45] By the late 2nd century, heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards.[46][47] These spread westwards across Eurasia.[48] Asian rice was domesticated 8,200–13,500 years ago – depending on the molecular clock estimate that is used[49]– on the Pearl River in southern China with a single genetic origin from the wild rice Oryza rufipogon.[50] In Greece and Rome, the major cereals were wheat, emmer, and barley, alongside vegetables including peas, beans, and olives. Sheep and goats were kept mainly for dairy products.[51][52] Agricultural scenes of threshing, a grain store, harvesting with sickles, digging, tree-cutting and ploughing from ancient Egypt. Tomb of Nakht, 15th century BC In the Americas, crops domesticated in Mesoamerica (apart from teosinte) include squash, beans, and cacao.[53] Cocoa was being domesticated by the Mayo Chinchipe of the upper Amazon around 3,000 BC.[54] The turkey was probably domesticated in Mexico or the American Southwest.[55] The Aztecs developed irrigation systems, formed terraced hillsides, fertilized their soil, and developed chinampas or artificial islands. The Mayas used extensive canal and raised field systems to farm swampland from 400 BC.[56][57][58][59][60] Coca was domesticated in the Andes, as were the peanut, tomato, tobacco, and pineapple.[53] Cotton was domesticated in Peru by 3,600 BC.[61] Animals including llamas, alpacas, and guinea pigs were domesticated there.[62] In North America, the indigenous people of the East domesticated crops such as sunflower, tobacco,[63] squash and Chenopodium.[64][65] Wild foods including wild rice and maple sugar were harvested.[66] The domesticated strawberry is a hybrid of a Chilean and a North American species, developed by breeding in Europe and North America.[67] The indigenous people of the Southwest and the Pacific Northwest practiced forest gardening and fire-stick farming. The natives controlled fire on a regional scale to create a low-intensity fire ecology that sustained a low-density agriculture in loose rotation; a sort of wild permaculture.[68][69][70][71] A system of companion planting called the Three Sisters was developed in North America. The three crops were winter squash, maize, and climbing beans.[72][73] Indigenous Australians, long supposed to have been nomadic hunter-gatherers, practised systematic burning, possibly to enhance natural productivity in fire-stick farming.[74] Scholars have pointed out that hunter-gatherers need a productive environment to support gathering without cultivation. Because the forests of New Guinea have few food plants, early humans may have used selective burning to increase the productivity of the wild karuka fruit trees to support the hunter-gatherer way of life.[75] The Gunditjmara and other groups developed eel farming and fish trapping systems from some 5,000 years ago.[76] There is evidence of 'intensification' across the whole continent over that period.[77] In two regions of Australia, the central west coast and eastern central, early farmers cultivated yams, native millet, and bush onions, possibly in permanent settlements.[31][78] Revolution Agricultural calendar, c. 1470, from a manuscript of Pietro de Crescenzi In the Middle Ages, compared to the Roman period, agriculture in Western Europe became more focused on self-sufficiency. The agricultural population under feudalism was typically organized into manors consisting of several hundred or more acres of land presided over by a lord of the manor with a Roman Catholic church and priest.[79] Thanks to the exchange with the Al-Andalus where the Arab Agricultural Revolution was underway, European agriculture transformed, with improved techniques and the diffusion of crop plants, including the introduction of sugar, rice, cotton and fruit trees (such as the orange).[80] After 1492, the Columbian exchange brought New World crops such as maize, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, and manioc to Europe, and Old World crops such as wheat, barley, rice, and turnips, and livestock (including horses, cattle, sheep and goats) to the Americas.[81] Irrigation, crop rotation, and fertilizers advanced from the 17th century with the British Agricultural Revolution, allowing global population to rise significantly. Since 1900, agriculture in developed nations, and to a lesser extent in the developing world, has seen large rises in productivity as mechanization replaces human labor, and assisted by synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, and selective breeding. The Haber-Bosch method allowed the synthesis of ammonium nitrate fertilizer on an industrial scale, greatly increasing crop yields and sustaining a further increase in global population.[82][83] Modern agriculture has raised or encountered ecological, political, and economic issues including water pollution, biofuels, genetically modified organisms, tariffs and farm subsidies, leading to alternative approaches such as the organic movement.[84][85] Unsustainable farming practices in North America led to the Dust Bowl of the 1930s.[86] Types Reindeer herds form the basis of pastoral agriculture for several Arctic and Subarctic peoples. Harvesting wheat with a combine harvester accompanied by a tractor and trailer Pastoralism involves managing domesticated animals. In nomadic pastoralism, herds of livestock are moved from place to place in search of pasture, fodder, and water. This type of farming is practised in arid and semi-arid regions of Sahara, Central Asia and some parts of India.[87] Spreading manure by hand in Zambia In shifting cultivation, a small area of forest is cleared by cutting and burning the trees. The cleared land is used for growing crops for a few years until the soil becomes too infertile, and the area is abandoned. Another patch of land is selected and the process is repeated. This type of farming is practiced mainly in areas with abundant rainfall where the forest regenerates quickly. This practice is used in Northeast India, Southeast Asia, and the Amazon Basin.[88] Subsistence farming is practiced to satisfy family or local needs alone, with little left over for transport elsewhere. It is intensively practiced in Monsoon Asia and South-East Asia.[89] An estimated 2.5 billion subsistence farmers worked in 2018, cultivating about 60% of the earth's arable land.[90] Intensive farming is cultivation to maximise productivity, with a low fallow ratio and a high use of inputs (water, fertilizer, pesticide and automation). It is practiced mainly in developed countries.[91][92] Contemporary agriculture Status From the twentieth century onwards, intensive agriculture increased crop productivity. It substituted synthetic fertilizers and pesticides for labour, but caused increased water pollution, and often involved farm subsidies. Soil degradation and diseases such as stem rust are major concerns globally;[93] approximately 40% of the world's agricultural land is seriously degraded.[94][95] In recent years there has been a backlash against the environmental effects of conventional agriculture, resulting in the organic, regenerative, and sustainable agriculture movements.[84][96] One of the major forces behind this movement has been the European Union, which first certified organic food in 1991 and began reform of its Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) in 2005 to phase out commodity-linked farm subsidies,[97] also known as decoupling. The growth of organic farming has renewed research in alternative technologies such as integrated pest management, selective breeding,[98] and controlled-environment agriculture.[99][100] There are concerns about the lower yield associated with organic farming and its impact on global food security.[101] Recent mainstream technological developments include genetically modified food.[102] Development of agricultural output of China in 2015 US$ since 1961 By 2015, the agricultural output of China was the largest in the world, followed by the European Union, India and the United States.[103] Economists measure the total factor productivity of agriculture, according to which agriculture in the United States is roughly 1.7 times more productive than it was in 1948.[104] Despite increases in agricultural production and productivity,[105] between 702 and 828 million people were affected by hunger in 2021.[106] Food insecurity and malnutrition can be the result of conflict, climate extremes and variability and economic swings.[105] It can also be caused by a country's structural characteristics such as income status and natural resource endowments as well as its political economy.[105] The International Fund for Agricultural Development posits that an increase in smallholder agriculture may be part of the solution to concerns about food prices and overall food security, given the favorable experience of Vietnam.[107] Workforce See also: Gender roles in agriculture Agriculture provides about one-quarter of all global employment, more than half in sub-Saharan Africa and almost 60 percent in low-income countries.[108] As countries develop, other jobs have historically pulled workers away from agriculture, and labour-saving innovations increase agricultural productivity by reducing labour requirements per unit of output.[109][110][111] Over time, a combination of labour supply and labour demand trends have driven down the share of population employed in agriculture.[112][113] On the three-sector theory, the proportion of people working in agriculture (left-hard bar in each group, green) falls as an economy becomes more developed. During the 16th century in Europe, between 55 and 75% of the population was engaged in agriculture; by the 19th century, this had dropped to between 35 and 65%.[114] In the same countries today, the figure is less than 10%.[115] At the start of the 21st century, some one billion people, or over 1/3 of the available work force, were employed in agriculture. This constitutes approximately 70% of the global employment of children, and in many countries constitutes the largest percentage of women of any industry.[116] The service sector overtook the agricultural sector as the largest global employer in 2007.[117] In many developed countries, immigrants help fill labour shortages in high-value agriculture activities that are difficult to mechanize.[118] Foreign farm workers from mostly Eastern Europe, North Africa and South Asia constituted around one-third of the salaried agricultural workforce in Spain, Italy, Greece and Portugal in 2013.[119][120][121][122] In the United States of America, more than half of all hired farmworkers (roughly 450,000 workers) were immigrants in 2019, although the number of new immigrants arriving in the country to work in agriculture has fallen by 75 percent in recent years and rising wages indicate this has led to a major labor shortage on U.S. farms.[123][124] Around the world, women make up a large share of the population employed in agriculture.[125] This share is growing in all developing regions except East and Southeast Asia where women already make up about 50 percent of the agricultural workforce.[125] Women make up 47 percent of the agricultural workforce in sub-Saharan Africa, a rate that has not changed significantly in the past few decades.[125] However, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) posits that the roles and responsibilities of women in agriculture may be changing – for example, from subsistence farming to wage employment, and from contributing household members to primary producers in the context of male-out-migration.[125] Safety Main article: Agricultural safety and health Rollover protection bar retrofitted to a mid-20th century Fordson tractor Agriculture, specifically farming, remains a hazardous industry, and farmers worldwide remain at high risk of work-related injuries, lung disease, noise-induced hearing loss, skin diseases, as well as certain cancers related to chemical use and prolonged sun exposure. On industrialized farms, injuries frequently involve the use of agricultural machinery, and a common cause of fatal agricultural injuries in developed countries is tractor rollovers.[126] Pesticides and other chemicals used in farming can be hazardous to worker health, and workers exposed to pesticides may experience illness or have children with birth defects.[127] As an industry in which families commonly share in work and live on the farm itself, entire families can be at risk for injuries, illness, and death.[128] Ages 0–6 May be an especially vulnerable population in agriculture;[129] common causes of fatal injuries among young farm workers include drowning, machinery and motor accidents, including with all-terrain vehicles.[128][129][130] The International Labour Organization considers agriculture one of the most hazardous of all economic sectors.[116] It estimates that the annual work-related death toll among agricultural employees is at least 170,000, twice the average rate of other jobs. In addition, incidences of death, injury and illness related to agricultural activities often go unreported.[131] The organization has developed the Safety and Health in Agriculture Convention, 2001, which covers the range of risks in the agriculture occupation, the prevention of these risks and the role that individuals and organizations engaged in agriculture should play.[116] In the United States, agriculture has been identified by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health as a priority industry sector in the National Occupational Research Agenda to identify and provide intervention strategies for occupational health and safety issues.[132][133] In the European Union, the European Agency for Safety and Health at Work has issued guidelines on implementing health and safety directives in agriculture, livestock farming, horticulture, and forestry.[134] The Agricultural Safety and Health Council of America (ASHCA) also holds a yearly summit to discuss safety.[135] Production Main article: List of countries by GDP sector composition See also: List of most important agricultural crops worldwide Value of agricultural production, 2016[136] Overall production varies by country as listed. Largest countries by agricultural output (in nominal terms) according to IMF and CIA World Factbook, at peak level as of 2018 Largest countries by agricultural output according to UNCTAD at 2005 constant prices and exchange rates, 2015[103] Crop cultivation systems Slash and burn shifting cultivation, Thailand Cropping systems vary among farms depending on the available resources and constraints; geography and climate of the farm; government policy; economic, social and political pressures; and the philosophy and culture of the farmer.[137][138] Shifting cultivation (or slash and burn) is a system in which forests are burnt, releasing nutrients to support cultivation of annual and then perennial crops for a period of several years.[139] Then the plot is left fallow to regrow forest, and the farmer moves to a new plot, returning after many more years (10–20). This fallow period is shortened if population density grows, requiring the input of nutrients (fertilizer or manure) and some manual pest control. Annual cultivation is the next phase of intensity in which there is no fallow period. This requires even greater nutrient and pest control inputs.[139] Intercropping of coconut and Mexican marigold Further industrialization led to the use of monocultures, when one cultivar is planted on a large acreage. Because of the low biodiversity, nutrient use is uniform and pests tend to build up, necessitating the greater use of pesticides and fertilizers.[138] Multiple cropping, in which several crops are grown sequentially in one year, and intercropping, when several crops are grown at the same time, are other kinds of annual cropping systems known as polycultures.[139] In subtropical and arid environments, the timing and extent of agriculture may be limited by rainfall, either not allowing multiple annual crops in a year, or requiring irrigation. In all of these environments perennial crops are grown (coffee, chocolate) and systems are practiced such as agroforestry. In temperate environments, where ecosystems were predominantly grassland or prairie, highly productive annual farming is the dominant agricultural system.[139] Important categories of food crops include cereals, legumes, forage, fruits and vegetables.[140] Natural fibers include cotton, wool, hemp, silk and flax.[141] Specific crops are cultivated in distinct growing regions throughout the world. Production is listed in millions of metric tons, based on FAO estimates.[140] Top agricultural products, by crop types (million tonnes) 2004 data Top agricultural products, by individual crops (million tonnes) 2011 data Livestock production systems Main articles: Livestock and Animal husbandry See also: List of domesticated animals Intensively farmed pigs Animal husbandry is the breeding and raising of animals for meat, milk, eggs, or wool, and for work and transport.[142] Working animals, including horses, mules, oxen, water buffalo, camels, llamas, alpacas, donkeys, and dogs, have for centuries been used to help cultivate fields, harvest crops, wrangle other animals, and transport farm products to buyers.[143] Livestock production systems can be defined based on feed source, as grassland-based, mixed, and landless.[144] As of 2010, 30% of Earth's ice- and water-free area was used for producing livestock, with the sector employing approximately 1.3 billion people. Between the 1960s and the 2000s, there was a significant increase in livestock production, both by numbers and by carcass weight, especially among beef, pigs and chickens, the latter of which had production increased by almost a factor of 10. Non-meat animals, such as milk cows and egg-producing chickens, also showed significant production increases. Global cattle, sheep and goat populations are expected to continue to increase sharply through 2050.[145] Aquaculture or fish farming, the production of fish for human consumption in confined operations, is one of the fastest growing sectors of food production, growing at an average of 9% a year between 1975 and 2007.[146] During the second half of the 20th century, producers using selective breeding focused on creating livestock breeds and crossbreeds that increased production, while mostly disregarding the need to preserve genetic diversity. This trend has led to a significant decrease in genetic diversity and resources among livestock breeds, leading to a corresponding decrease in disease resistance and local adaptations previously found among traditional breeds.[147] Raising chickens intensively for meat in a broiler house Grassland based livestock production relies upon plant material such as shrubland, rangeland, and pastures for feeding ruminant animals. Outside nutrient inputs may be used, however manure is returned directly to the grassland as a major nutrient source. This system is particularly important in areas where crop production is not feasible because of climate or soil, representing 30–40 million pastoralists.[139] Mixed production systems use grassland, fodder crops and grain feed crops as feed for ruminant and monogastric (one stomach; mainly chickens and pigs) livestock. Manure is typically recycled in mixed systems as a fertilizer for crops.[144] Landless systems rely upon feed from outside the farm, representing the de-linking of crop and livestock production found more prevalently in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development member countries. Synthetic fertilizers are more heavily relied upon for crop production and manure use becomes a challenge as well as a source for pollution.[144] Industrialized countries use these operations to produce much of the global supplies of poultry and pork. Scientists estimate that 75% of the growth in livestock production between 2003 and 2030 will be in confined animal feeding operations, sometimes called factory farming. Much of this growth is happening in developing countries in Asia, with much smaller amounts of growth in Africa.[145] Some of the practices used in commercial livestock production, including the usage of growth hormones, are controversial.[148] Production practices Tilling an arable field Further information: Tillage, Crop rotation, and Irrigation Tillage is the practice of breaking up the soil with tools such as the plow or harrow to prepare for planting, for nutrient incorporation, or for pest control. Tillage varies in intensity from conventional to no-till. It can improve productivity by warming the soil, incorporating fertilizer and controlling weeds, but also renders soil more prone to erosion, triggers the decomposition of organic matter releasing CO2, and reduces the abundance and diversity of soil organisms.[149][150] Pest control includes the management of weeds, insects, mites, and diseases. Chemical (pesticides), biological (biocontrol), mechanical (tillage), and cultural practices are used. Cultural practices include crop rotation, culling, cover crops, intercropping, composting, avoidance, and resistance. Integrated pest management attempts to use all of these methods to keep pest populations below the number which would cause economic loss, and recommends pesticides as a last resort.[151] Nutrient management includes both the source of nutrient inputs for crop and livestock production, and the method of use of manure produced by livestock. Nutrient inputs can be chemical inorganic fertilizers, manure, green manure, compost and minerals.[152] Crop nutrient use may also be managed using cultural techniques such as crop rotation or a fallow period. Manure is used either by holding livestock where the feed crop is growing, such as in managed intensive rotational grazing, or by spreading either dry or liquid formulations of manure on cropland or pastures.[149][153] A center pivot irrigation system Water management is needed where rainfall is insufficient or variable, which occurs to some degree in most regions of the world.[139] Some farmers use irrigation to supplement rainfall. In other areas such as the Great Plains in the U.S. and Canada, farmers use a fallow year to conserve soil moisture for the following year.[154] Recent technological innovations in precision agriculture allow for water status monitoring and automate water usage, leading to more efficient management.[155] Agriculture represents 70% of freshwater use worldwide.[156] However, water withdrawal ratios for agriculture vary significantly by income level. In least developed countries and landlocked developing countries, water withdrawal ratios for agriculture are as high as 90 percent of total water withdrawals and about 60 percent in Small Island Developing States.[157] According to 2014 report by the International Food Policy Research Institute, agricultural technologies will have the greatest impact on food production if adopted in combination with each other. Using a model that assessed how eleven technologies could impact agricultural productivity, food security and trade by 2050, the International Food Policy Research Institute found that the number of people at risk from hunger could be reduced by as much as 40% and food prices could be reduced by almost half.[158] Payment for ecosystem services is a method of providing additional incentives to encourage farmers to conserve some aspects of the environment. Measures might include paying for reforestation upstream of a city, to improve the supply of fresh water.[159] Agricultural automation Different definitions exist for agricultural automation and for the variety of tools and technologies that are used to automate production. One view is that agricultural automation refers to autonomous navigation by robots without human intervention.[160] Alternatively it is defined as the accomplishment of production tasks through mobile, autonomous, decision-making, mechatronic devices.[161] However, FAO finds that these definitions do not capture all the aspects and forms of automation, such as robotic milking machines that are static, most motorized machinery that automates the performing of agricultural operations, and digital tools (e.g., sensors) that automate only diagnosis.[155] FAO defines agricultural automation as the use of machinery and equipment in agricultural operations to improve their diagnosis, decision-making or performing, reducing the drudgery of agricultural work or improving the timeliness, and potentially the precision, of agricultural operations.[162] The technological evolution in agriculture has involved a progressive move from manual tools to animal traction, to motorized mechanization, to digital equipment and finally, to robotics with artificial intelligence (AI).[162] Motorized mechanization using engine power automates the performance of agricultural operations such as ploughing and milking.[163] With digital automation technologies, it also becomes possible to automate diagnosis and decision-making of agricultural operations.[162] For example, autonomous crop robots can harvest and seed crops, while drones can gather information to help automate input application.[155] Precision agriculture often employs such automation technologies.[155] Motorized machines are increasingly complemented, or even superseded, by new digital equipment that automates diagnosis and decision-making.[163] A conventional tractor, for example, can be converted into an automated vehicle allowing it to sow a field autonomously.[163] Motorized mechanization has increased significantly across the world in recent years, although reliable global data with broad country coverage exist only for tractors and only up to 2009.[164] Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region where the adoption of motorized mechanization has stalled over the past decades.[155][165] Automation technologies are increasingly used for managing livestock, though evidence on adoption is lacking. Global automatic milking system sales have increased over recent years, but adoption is likely mostly in Northern Europe,[166] and likely almost absent in low- and middle-income countries. Automated feeding machines for both cows and poultry also exist, but data and evidence regarding their adoption trends and drivers is likewise scarce.[167][155] Measuring the overall employment impacts of agricultural automation is difficult because it requires large amounts of data tracking all the transformations and the associated reallocation of workers both upstream and downstream.[162] While automation technologies reduce labour needs for the newly automated tasks, they also generate new labour demand for other tasks, such as equipment maintenance and operation.[155] Agricultural automation can also stimulate employment by allowing producers to expand production and by creating other agrifood systems jobs.[168] This is especially true when it happens in context of rising scarcity of rural labour, as is the case in high-income countries and many middle-income countries.[168] On the other hand, if forcedly promoted, for example through government subsidies in contexts of abundant rural labour, it can lead to labour displacement and falling or stagnant wages, particularly affecting poor and low-skilled workers.[168] Effects of climate change on yields Main article: Effects of climate change on agriculture Winnowing grain: global warming will probably harm crop yields in low latitude countries like Ethiopia. Climate change and agriculture are interrelated on a global scale. Climate change affects agriculture through changes in average temperatures, rainfall, and weather extremes (like storms and heat waves); changes in pests and diseases; changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide and ground-level ozone concentrations; changes in the nutritional quality of some foods;[169] and changes in sea level.[170] Global warming is already affecting agriculture, with effects unevenly distributed across the world.[171] In a 2022 report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change describes how human-induced warming has slowed growth of agricultural productivity over the past 50 years in mid and low latitudes.[172] Methane emissions have negatively impacted crop yields by increasing temperatures and surface ozone concentrations.[172] Warming is also negatively affecting crop and grassland quality and harvest stability.[172] Ocean warming has decreased sustainable yields of some wild fish populations while ocean acidification and warming have already affected farmed aquatic species.[172] Climate change will probably increase the risk of food insecurity for some vulnerable groups, such as the poor.[173] Crop alteration and biotechnology Plant breeding Main article: Plant breeding Wheat cultivar tolerant of high salinity (left) compared with non-tolerant variety Crop alteration has been practiced by humankind for thousands of years, since the beginning of civilization. Altering crops through breeding practices changes the genetic make-up of a plant to develop crops with more beneficial characteristics for humans, for example, larger fruits or seeds, drought-tolerance, or resistance to pests. Significant advances in plant breeding ensued after the work of geneticist Gregor Mendel. His work on dominant and recessive alleles, although initially largely ignored for almost 50 years, gave plant breeders a better understanding of genetics and breeding techniques. Crop breeding includes techniques such as plant selection with desirable traits, self-pollination and cross-pollination, and molecular techniques that genetically modify the organism.[174] Domestication of plants has, over the centuries increased yield, improved disease resistance and drought tolerance, eased harvest and improved the taste and nutritional value of crop plants. Careful selection and breeding have had enormous effects on the characteristics of crop plants. Plant selection and breeding in the 1920s and 1930s improved pasture (grasses and clover) in New Zealand. Extensive X-ray and ultraviolet induced mutagenesis efforts (i.e. primitive genetic engineering) during the 1950s produced the modern commercial varieties of grains such as wheat, corn (maize) and barley.[175][176] Seedlings in a green house. This is what it looks like when seedlings are growing from plant breeding. The Green Revolution popularized the use of conventional hybridization to sharply increase yield by creating high-yielding varieties. For example, average yields of corn (maize) in the US have increased from around 2.5 tons per hectare (t/ha) (40 bushels per acre) in 1900 to about 9.4 t/ha (150 bushels per acre) in 2001. Similarly, worldwide average wheat yields have increased from less than 1 t/ha in 1900 to more than 2.5 t/ha in 1990. South American average wheat yields are around 2 t/ha, African under 1 t/ha, and Egypt and Arabia up to 3.5 to 4 t/ha with irrigation. In contrast, the average wheat yield in countries such as France is over 8 t/ha. Variations in yields are due mainly to variation in climate, genetics, and the level of intensive farming techniques (use of fertilizers, chemical pest control, and growth control to avoid lodging).[177][178][179] Genetic engineering Main article: Genetic engineering See also: Genetically modified food, Genetically modified crops, Regulation of the release of genetic modified organisms, and Genetically modified food controversies Genetically modified potato plants (left) resist virus diseases that damage unmodified plants (right). Genetically modified organisms (GMO) are organisms whose genetic material has been altered by genetic engineering techniques generally known as recombinant DNA technology. Genetic engineering has expanded the genes available to breeders to use in creating desired germlines for new crops. Increased durability, nutritional content, insect and virus resistance and herbicide tolerance are a few of the attributes bred into crops through genetic engineering.[180] For some, GMO crops cause food safety and food labeling concerns. Numerous countries have placed restrictions on the production, import or use of GMO foods and crops.[181] The Biosafety Protocol, an international treaty, regulates the trade of GMOs. There is ongoing discussion regarding the labeling of foods made from GMOs, and while the EU currently requires all GMO foods to be labeled, the US does not.[182] Herbicide-resistant seeds have a gene implanted into their genome that allows the plants to tolerate exposure to herbicides, including glyphosate. These seeds allow the farmer to grow a crop that can be sprayed with herbicides to control weeds without harming the resistant crop. Herbicide-tolerant crops are used by farmers worldwide.[183] With the increasing use of herbicide-tolerant crops, comes an increase in the use of glyphosate-based herbicide sprays. In some areas glyphosate resistant weeds have developed, causing farmers to switch to other herbicides.[184][185] Some studies also link widespread glyphosate usage to iron deficiencies in some crops, which is both a crop production and a nutritional quality concern, with potential economic and health implications.[186] Other GMO crops used by growers include insect-resistant crops, which have a gene from the soil bacterium Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt), which produces a toxin specific to insects. These crops resist damage by insects.[187] Some believe that similar or better pest-resistance traits can be acquired through traditional breeding practices, and resistance to various pests can be gained through hybridization or cross-pollination with wild species. In some cases, wild species are the primary source of resistance traits; some tomato cultivars that have gained resistance to at least 19 diseases did so through crossing with wild populations of tomatoes.[188] Environmental impact Main article: Environmental issues with agriculture Effects and costs Water pollution in a rural stream due to runoff from farming activity in New Zealand Agriculture is both a cause of and sensitive to environmental degradation, such as biodiversity loss, desertification, soil degradation and climate change, which cause decreases in crop yield.[189] Agriculture is one of the most important drivers of environmental pressures, particularly habitat change, climate change, water use and toxic emissions. Agriculture is the main source of toxins released into the environment, including insecticides, especially those used on cotton.[190][191][page needed] The 2011 UNEP Green Economy report stated that agricultural operations produced some 13 per cent of anthropogenic global greenhouse gas emissions. This includes gases from the use of inorganic fertilizers, agro-chemical pesticides, and herbicides, as well as fossil fuel-energy inputs.[192] Agriculture imposes multiple external costs upon society through effects such as pesticide damage to nature (especially herbicides and insecticides), nutrient runoff, excessive water usage, and loss of natural environment. A 2000 assessment of agriculture in the UK determined total external costs for 1996 of £2,343 million, or £208 per hectare.[193] A 2005 analysis of these costs in the US concluded that cropland imposes approximately $5 to $16 billion ($30 to $96 per hectare), while livestock production imposes $714 million.[194] Both studies, which focused solely on the fiscal impacts, concluded that more should be done to internalize external costs. Neither included subsidies in their analysis, but they noted that subsidies also influence the cost of agriculture to society.[193][194] Agriculture seeks to increase yield and to reduce costs, often employing measures that cut biodiversity to very low levels. Yield increases with inputs such as fertilisers and removal of pathogens, predators, and competitors (such as weeds). Costs decrease with increasing scale of farm units, such as making fields larger; this means removing hedges, ditches and other areas of habitat. Pesticides kill insects, plants and fungi. Effective yields fall with on-farm losses, which may be caused by poor production practices during harvesting, handling, and storage.[195] The environmental effects of climate change show that research on pests and diseases that do not generally afflict areas is essential. In 2021, farmers discovered stem rust on wheat in the Champagne area of France, a disease that had previously only occurred in Morocco for 20 to 30 years. Because of climate change, insects that used to die off over the winter are now alive and multiplying.[196][197] Livestock issues Farmyard anaerobic digester converts waste plant material and manure from livestock into biogas fuel. A senior UN official, Henning Steinfeld, said that Livestock are one of the most significant contributors to today's most serious environmental problems.[198] Livestock production occupies 70% of all land used for agriculture, or 30% of the land surface of the planet. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases, responsible for 18% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO2 equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO2. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO2) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO2.) It also generates 64% of the ammonia emission. Livestock expansion is cited as a key factor driving deforestation; in the Amazon basin 70% of previously forested area is now occupied by pastures and the remainder used for feed crops.[199] Through deforestation and land degradation, livestock is also driving reductions in biodiversity. Furthermore, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) states that methane emissions from global livestock are projected to increase by 60 per cent by 2030 under current practices and consumption patterns.[192] Land and water issues See also: Environmental impact of irrigation Circular irrigated crop fields in Kansas. Healthy, growing crops of corn and sorghum are green (sorghum may be slightly paler). Wheat is brilliant gold. Fields of brown have been recently harvested and plowed or have lain in fallow for the year. Land transformation, the use of land to yield goods and services, is the most substantial way humans alter the Earth's ecosystems, and is the driving force causing biodiversity loss. Estimates of the amount of land transformed by humans vary from 39 to 50%.[200] Land degradation, the long-term decline in ecosystem function and productivity, is estimated to be occurring on 24% of land worldwide, with cropland overrepresented.[201] Land management is the driving factor behind degradation; 1.5 billion people rely upon the degrading land. Degradation can be through deforestation, desertification, soil erosion, mineral depletion, acidification, or salinization.[139] Eutrophication, excessive nutrient enrichment in aquatic ecosystems resulting in algal blooms and anoxia, leads to fish kills, loss of biodiversity, and renders water unfit for drinking and other industrial uses. Excessive fertilization and manure application to cropland, as well as high livestock stocking densities cause nutrient (mainly nitrogen and phosphorus) runoff and leaching from agricultural land. These nutrients are major nonpoint pollutants contributing to eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and pollution of groundwater, with harmful effects on human populations.[202] Fertilisers also reduce terrestrial biodiversity by increasing competition for light, favouring those species that are able to benefit from the added nutrients.[203] Agriculture simultaneously is facing growing freshwater demand and precipitation anomalies (droughts, floods, and extreme rainfall and weather events) on rainfed areasfields and grazing lands.[157] Agriculture accounts for 70 percent of withdrawals of freshwater resources,[204][205] and an estimated 41 percent of current global irrigation water use occurs at the expense of environmental flow requirements.[157] It is long known that aquifers in areas as diverse as northern China, the Upper Ganges and the western US are being depleted, and new research extends these problems to aquifers in Iran, Mexico and Saudi Arabia.[206] Increasing pressure is being placed on water resources by industry and urban areas, meaning that water scarcity is increasing and agriculture is facing the challenge of producing more food for the world's growing population with reduced water resources.[207] While industrial withdrawals have declined in the past few decades and municipal withdrawals have increased only marginally since 2010, agricultural withdrawals have continued to grow at an ever faster pace.[157] Agricultural water usage can also cause major environmental problems, including the destruction of natural wetlands, the spread of water-borne diseases, and land degradation through salinization and waterlogging, when irrigation is performed incorrectly.[208] Pesticides Main article: Environmental impact of pesticides Spraying a crop with a pesticide Pesticide use has increased since 1950 to 2.5 million short tons annually worldwide, yet crop loss from pests has remained relatively constant.[209] The World Health Organization estimated in 1992 that three million pesticide poisonings occur annually, causing 220,000 deaths.[210] Pesticides select for pesticide resistance in the pest population, leading to a condition termed the pesticide treadmill in which pest resistance warrants the development of a new pesticide.[211] An alternative argument is that the way to save the environment and prevent famine is by using pesticides and intensive high yield farming, a view exemplified by a quote heading the Center for Global Food Issues website: 'Growing more per acre leaves more land for nature'.[212][213] However, critics argue that a trade-off between the environment and a need for food is not inevitable,[214] and that pesticides can replace good agronomic practices such as crop rotation.[211] The Push–pull agricultural pest management technique involves intercropping, using plant aromas to repel pests from crops (push) and to lure them to a place from which they can then be removed (pull).[215] Contribution to climate change Main article: Greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture Agriculture contributes towards climate change through greenhouse gas emissions and by the conversion of non-agricultural land such as forests into agricultural land.[216] The agriculture, forestry and land use sector contribute between 13% and 21% of global greenhouse gas emissions.[217] Emissions of nitrous oxide, methane make up over half of total greenhouse gas emission from agriculture.[218] Animal husbandry is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions.[219] Approximately 57% of global GHG emissions from the production of food are from the production of animal-based food while plant-based foods contribute 29% and the remaining 14% is for other utilizations.[220] Farmland management and land-use change represented major shares of total emissions (38% and 29%, respectively), whereas rice and beef were the largest contributing plant- and animal-based commodities (12% and 25%, respectively).[220] South and Southeast Asia and South America were the largest emitters of production-based GHGs.[220] Sustainability Terraces, conservation tillage and conservation buffers reduce soil erosion and water pollution on this farm in Iowa. Main article: Sustainable agriculture Current farming methods have resulted in over-stretched water resources, high levels of erosion and reduced soil fertility. There is not enough water to continue farming using current practices; therefore how water, land, and ecosystem resources are used to boost crop yields must be reconsidered. A solution would be to give value to ecosystems, recognizing environmental and livelihood tradeoffs, and balancing the rights of a variety of users and interests.[221] Inequities that result when such measures are adopted would need to be addressed, such as the reallocation of water from poor to rich, the clearing of land to make way for more productive farmland, or the preservation of a wetland system that limits fishing rights.[222] Technological advancements help provide farmers with tools and resources to make farming more sustainable.[223] Technology permits innovations like conservation tillage, a farming process which helps prevent land loss to erosion, reduces water pollution, and enhances carbon sequestration.[224] Agricultural automation can help address some of the challenges associated with climate change and thus facilitate adaptation efforts.[155] For example, the application of digital automation technologies (e.g. in precision agriculture) can improve resource-use efficiency in conditions which are increasingly constrained for agricultural producers.[155] Moreover, when applied to sensing and early warning, they can help address the uncertainty and unpredictability of weather conditions associated with accelerating climate change.[155] Other potential sustainable practices include conservation agriculture, agroforestry, improved grazing, avoided grassland conversion, and biochar.[225][226] Current mono-crop farming practices in the United States preclude widespread adoption of sustainable practices, such as 2–3 crop rotations that incorporate grass or hay with annual crops, unless negative emission goals such as soil carbon sequestration become policy.[227] The food demand of Earth's projected population, with current climate change predictions, could be satisfied by improvement of agricultural methods, expansion of agricultural areas, and a sustainability-oriented consumer mindset.[228] Energy dependence Mechanised agriculture: from the first models in the 1940s, tools like a cotton picker could replace 50 farm workers, at the price of increased use of fossil fuel. Since the 1940s, agricultural productivity has increased dramatically, due largely to the increased use of energy-intensive mechanization, fertilizers and pesticides. The vast majority of this energy input comes from fossil fuel sources.[229] Between the 1960s and the 1980s, the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, with world grain production increasing significantly (between 70% and 390% for wheat and 60% to 150% for rice, depending on geographic area)[230] as world population doubled. Heavy reliance on petrochemicals has raised concerns that oil shortages could increase costs and reduce agricultural output.[231] Industrialized agriculture depends on fossil fuels in two fundamental ways: direct consumption on the farm and manufacture of inputs used on the farm. Direct consumption includes the use of lubricants and fuels to operate farm vehicles and machinery.[231] Indirect consumption includes the manufacture of fertilizers, pesticides, and farm machinery.[231] In particular, the production of nitrogen fertilizer can account for over half of agricultural energy usage.[232] Together, direct and indirect consumption by US farms accounts for about 2% of the nation's energy use. Direct and indirect energy consumption by U.S. farms peaked in 1979, and has since gradually declined.[231] Food systems encompass not just agriculture but off-farm processing, packaging, transporting, marketing, consumption, and disposal of food and food-related items. Agriculture accounts for less than one-fifth of food system energy use in the US.[233][234] Plastic pollution Main articles: Plastic pollution and plasticulture Plastic products are used extensively in agriculture, including to increase crop yields and improve the efficiency of water and agrichemical use. Agriplastic products include films to cover greenhouses and tunnels, mulch to cover soil (e.g. to suppress weeds, conserve water, increase soil temperature and aid fertilizer application), shade cloth, pesticide containers, seedling trays, protective mesh and irrigation tubing. The polymers most commonly used in these products are low- density polyethylene (LPDE), linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE), polypropylene (PP) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).[235] The total amount of plastics used in agriculture is difficult to quantify. A 2012 study reported that almost 6.5 million tonnes per year were consumed globally while a later study estimated that global demand in 2015 was between 7.3 million and 9 million tonnes. Widespread use of plastic mulch and lack of systematic collection and management have led to the generation of large amounts of mulch residue. Weathering and degradation eventually cause the mulch to fragment. These fragments and larger pieces of plastic accumulate in soil. Mulch residue has been measured at levels of 50 to 260 kg per hectare in topsoil in areas where mulch use dates back more than 10 years, which confirms that mulching is a major source of both microplastic and macroplastic soil contamination.[235] Agricultural plastics, especially plastic films, are not easy to recycle because of high contamination levels (up to 40–50% by weight contamination by pesticides, fertilizers, soil and debris, moist vegetation, silage juice water, and UV stabilizers) and collection difficulties . Therefore, they are often buried or abandoned in fields and watercourses or burned. These disposal practices lead to soil degradation and can result in contamination of soils and leakage of microplastics into the marine environment as a result of precipitation run-off and tidal washing. In addition, additives in residual plastic film (such as UV and thermal stabilizers) may have deleterious effects on crop growth, soil structure, nutrient transport and salt levels. There is a risk that plastic mulch will deteriorate soil quality, deplete soil organic matter stocks, increase soil water repellence and emit greenhouse gases. Microplastics released through fragmentation of agricultural plastics can absorb and concentrate contaminants capable of being passed up the trophic chain.[235] Disciplines Agricultural economics Main article: Agricultural economics In 19th century Britain, the protectionist Corn Laws led to high prices and widespread protest, such as this 1846 meeting of the Anti-Corn Law League.[236] Agricultural economics is economics as it relates to the production, distribution and consumption of [agricultural] goods and services.[237] Combining agricultural production with general theories of marketing and business as a discipline of study began in the late 1800s, and grew significantly through the 20th century.[238] Although the study of agricultural economics is relatively recent, major trends in agriculture have significantly affected national and international economies throughout history, ranging from tenant farmers and sharecropping in the post-American Civil War Southern United States[239] to the European feudal system of manorialism.[240] In the United States, and elsewhere, food costs attributed to food processing, distribution, and agricultural marketing, sometimes referred to as the value chain, have risen while the costs attributed to farming have declined. This is related to the greater efficiency of farming, combined with the increased level of value addition (e.g. more highly processed products) provided by the supply chain. Market concentration has increased in the sector as well, and although the total effect of the increased market concentration is likely increased efficiency, the changes redistribute economic surplus from producers (farmers) and consumers, and may have negative implications for rural communities.[241] National government policies, such as taxation, subsidies, tariffs and others, can significantly change the economic marketplace for agricultural products.[242] Since at least the 1960s, a combination of trade restrictions, exchange rate policies and subsidies have affected farmers in both the developing and the developed world. In the 1980s, non-subsidized farmers in developing countries experienced adverse effects from national policies that created artificially low global prices for farm products. Between the mid-1980s and the early 2000s, several international agreements limited agricultural tariffs, subsidies and other trade restrictions.[243] However, as of 2009, there was still a significant amount of policy-driven distortion in global agricultural product prices. The three agricultural products with the most trade distortion were sugar, milk and rice, mainly due to taxation. Among the oilseeds, sesame had the most taxation, but overall, feed grains and oilseeds had much lower levels of taxation than livestock products. Since the 1980s, policy-driven distortions have decreases more among livestock products than crops during the worldwide reforms in agricultural policy.[242] Despite this progress, certain crops, such as cotton, still see subsidies in developed countries artificially deflating global prices, causing hardship in developing countries with non-subsidized farmers.[244] Unprocessed commodities such as corn, soybeans, and cattle are generally graded to indicate quality, affecting the price the producer receives. Commodities are generally reported by production quantities, such as volume, number or weight.[245] Agricultural science Main article: Agricultural science Further information: Agronomy An agronomist mapping a plant genome Agricultural science is a broad multidisciplinary field of biology that encompasses the parts of exact, natural, economic and social sciences used in the practice and understanding of agriculture. It covers topics such as agronomy, plant breeding and genetics, plant pathology, crop modelling, soil science, entomology, production techniques and improvement, study of pests and their management, and study of adverse environmental effects such as soil degradation, waste management, and bioremediation.[246][247] The scientific study of agriculture began in the 18th century, when Johann Friedrich Mayer conducted experiments on the use of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulphate) as a fertilizer.[248] Research became more systematic when in 1843, John Lawes and Henry Gilbert began a set of long-term agronomy field experiments at Rothamsted Research Station in England; some of them, such as the Park Grass Experiment, are still running.[249][250] In America, the Hatch Act of 1887 provided funding for what it was the first to call agricultural science, driven by farmers' interest in fertilizers.[251] In agricultural entomology, the USDA began to research biological control in 1881; it instituted its first large program in 1905, searching Europe and Japan for natural enemies of the gypsy moth and brown-tail moth, establishing parasitoids (such as solitary wasps) and predators of both pests in the US.[252][253][254] Policy Main article: Agricultural policy Direct subsidies for animal products and feed by OECD countries in 2012, in billions of US dollars[255] Product Subsidy Beef and veal 18.0 Milk 15.3 Pigs 7.3 Poultry 6.5 Soybeans 2.3 Eggs 1.5 Sheep 1.1 Agricultural policy is the set of government decisions and actions relating to domestic agriculture and imports of foreign agricultural products. Governments usually implement agricultural policies with the goal of achieving a specific outcome in the domestic agricultural product markets. Some overarching themes include risk management and adjustment (including policies related to climate change, food safety and natural disasters), economic stability (including policies related to taxes), natural resources and environmental sustainability (especially water policy), research and development, and market access for domestic commodities (including relations with global organizations and agreements with other countries).[256] Agricultural policy can also touch on food quality, ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality, food security, ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs, and conservation. Policy programs can range from financial programs, such as subsidies, to encouraging producers to enroll in voluntary quality assurance programs.[257] A 2021 report finds that globally, support to agricultural producers accounts for almost US$540 billion a year.[258] This amounts to 15 percent of total agricultural production value, and is heavily biased towards measures that are leading to inefficiency, as well as are unequally distributed and harmful for the environment and human health.[258] There are many influences on the creation of agricultural policy, including consumers, agribusiness, trade lobbies and other groups. Agribusiness interests hold a large amount of influence over policy making, in the form of lobbying and campaign contributions. Political action groups, including those interested in environmental issues and labor unions, also provide influence, as do lobbying organizations representing individual agricultural commodities.[259] The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leads international efforts to defeat hunger and provides a forum for the negotiation of global agricultural regulations and agreements. Samuel Jutzi, director of FAO's animal production and health division, states that lobbying by large corporations has stopped reforms that would improve human health and the environment. For example, proposals in 2010 for a voluntary code of conduct for the livestock industry that would have provided incentives for improving standards for health, and environmental regulations, such as the number of animals an area of land can support without long-term damage, were successfully defeated due to large food company pressure.[260]\"    \n",

Rice plant depends mainly for its nitrogen upon the decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions and in the early stages of growth takes up nitrogen in the form of ammonia which is the stable form of nitrogen in submerged soils. There are two stages in the growth of rice crop when nitrogen is most needed; early vegetative and panicle initiation stages. Fertilizing the crop during early vegetative growth promotes tillering leading to higher yield. Application at panicle initiation or early booting stage will help the plant produce more and heavier grains per panicle. Phosphorus is particularly important in early growth stages. It is mobile within the plant and promotes root development (Particularly the development of fibrous roots),tillering and early flowering.

Nitrogen, the most important nutrient for rice, is universally limiting the rice productivity. Nitrogen encourages the vegetative development of plants by imparting a healthy green color to the leaves. It seems that majority of Indica varieties are adapted to relatively low levels of nitrogen in the region of 25 kg N/ha. Rice plant depends mainly for its nitrogen upon the decomposition of organic matter under anaerobic conditions and in the early stages of growth takes up nitrogen in the form of ammonia which is the stable form of nitrogen in submerged soils.
