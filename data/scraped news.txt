0,Budget allocations for agriculture must benefit small and marginal farmers,2023-02-24 22:43:06+05:30,['Dr T Prabhakar Reddy'],"['farmers', 'agriculture', 'states', 'telangana', 'change', 'climate', 'budget', 'state', 'suicides', 'benefit', 'allocations', 'land', 'small', 'cent', 'marginal']","Agriculture has been adversely impacted by climate change while a sizeable number of small and marginal farmers are disproportionately affected by it.
It was suggested that Union and State governments prepare State Adaptation Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) involving the stakeholders, including their perceptions and implement the same with adequate budget allocations.
In fact, adaptation to short-term climate variability and extreme events serves as a starting point for reducing vulnerability to long-term climate change.
The initiatives mentioned in Union Budget 2023-24 and Telangana state’s budget with respect to ‘agriculture and farmers’ welfare’ are mere palliatives but not panacea for addressing the challenges of climate change in the context of small and marginal farmers, who constitute 84 per cent of the country’s agriculture.
Further, the budget allocations did not focus on addressing the climate change, which is structural in nature, and instead focussed on providing loans to the farming community without any appropriate guidelines.","Agriculture has been adversely impacted by climate change while a sizeable number of small and marginal farmers are disproportionately affected by it. We should understand that the agrarian crisis that is prevailing in Indian economy is structural, implying that it cannot be addressed with symptomatic treatment.

Factors like size of land holding, availability of irrigation, cheaper institutional credit and the impact of climate change have a direct bearing on agriculture.

Recently the Indian Meteorological Department announced that the average rainfall will be less in the current year compared to last year due to El Nino and La Nino effects, which means that agriculture will take a further beating.

It is pertinent to mention a study on the ‘Impact of Climate Change on Indian Agriculture’ covering 200 districts, which has revealed that farmers’ adaptations to annual weather shocks and their inability due to lack of information and resources make them vulnerable (R P Guiteras, 2009). Further, the study mentioned that reduction in major crop yields by 4.5 to 9 per cent due to climate change and in the long run stretching up to 25 per cent is a serious challenge that should be taken into account while planning for farmers’ welfare. It was suggested that Union and State governments prepare State Adaptation Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) involving the stakeholders, including their perceptions and implement the same with adequate budget allocations. In fact, adaptation to short-term climate variability and extreme events serves as a starting point for reducing vulnerability to long-term climate change.

The initiatives mentioned in Union Budget 2023-24 and Telangana state’s budget with respect to ‘agriculture and farmers’ welfare’ are mere palliatives but not panacea for addressing the challenges of climate change in the context of small and marginal farmers, who constitute 84 per cent of the country’s agriculture. Further, the budget allocations did not focus on addressing the climate change, which is structural in nature, and instead focussed on providing loans to the farming community without any appropriate guidelines. Therefore, it is argued that utilization of the same allocations for the farmers’ welfare, especially small and marginal farmers, focusing on short-term climate variability and extreme events is the need of the hour. Further, adaptation policies and interventions need to be designed based on the district level agro-climatic situation rather than adopting ‘one size fits all’ approach, which does not hold good.

Farmer suicides:

It is a fact that the farmers’ suicides continued unabated in India, especially in states like Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka and Telangana despite the government’s claim that they are addressing the issue.

Thousands of crores of rupees have been disbursed in the name of “Rythu Bandhu” scheme in Telangana but what is the impact of it on farming community. Who are real beneficiaries? If it is really meant for ‘agricultural investment support’ to the farmers why are many resorting to suicides? An examination of the policy pertaining to Rythu Bandhu scheme revealed that it has flaws such as farmers with more than 10 acres of land are paid the benefit; including the NRIs, retired bureaucrats and income tax payers while absence of same benefit to the tenant farmers and other labourers is the crux of the matter. Awareness generation and identification of needy farmers is critical for the scheme’s success.

The national picture shows that states with higher percentage of suicides, Maharashtra, Tamil Nādu, West Bengal, MP and Karnataka with 13.5 per cent, 11.5 per cent, 9.1 per cent, 8.2 per cent, and 8 per cent, respectively. Telangana, with 6.2 per cent of suicides during 2021, stands second in the dubious list. Surprisingly, they are relatively performing states and registered very good per capita income in the recent past. When growth of GSDP and per capita income are relatively high how come the farming community is resorting to suicides in these states? Why are governments’ neglecting the welfare of farming community, including farmers, tenants and agricultural labourers? It appears that the economic inequalities are rising in these states and the gap between rich and poor is widening further. Given the huge population, the economic inequalities in India are contributing to global inequalities, which, as a result, are raising social cohesion concerns.

According to a National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) report, Telangana state experienced 26 per cent variation in suicides in 2021 over the previous year but was the highest among all states and UTs. Further, the rate of suicides, the number of suicides per lakh population, the standard yardstick for comparison, Telangana registered 26.9 in 2021 and stood in fourth place while the national average was 12.

In contrast, Telangana is boasting that a state with two per cent of national population contributed the fifth largest share of its GDP. Besides, the per capita income increased by 130 per cent to Rs. 278,000 in seven years and GSDP shot up from Rs. 5.6 lakh crore to Rs. 11.54 lakh crore. But the question is why has there been a haphazard and uneven distribution in the ‘progressive’ state. A recent study revealed that inequalities in Telangana have increased after the new state was created.

Among the causes leading to suicides in Telangana were family problems (33.2%) and illness (18.6%). Gender and age-wise distribution of suicide victims revealed that it was mostly men from the working age population who have taken the extreme step. The percentage distribution of suicide victims by profession in 2021 revealed that the daily wage earners are the maximum (25.6 per cent) when compared to other categories. In fact, the daily wage earners are mostly landless, while those who possess land find it an unviable proposition and end up becoming tenant farmers. Alas, tenant farmers are excluded from Rythu Bandhu by definition and denied their due share. A study conducted by this author to understand the impact of Rythu Bandhu on agriculture in Karimnagar, Jagtial and Nizamabad districts drew mixed results.

Inappropriate policies and inequalities:

The rich farmer class with more than 50-100 acres is receiving Rs. five to ten lakh benefits every year. Instead it should have benefited the small and marginal farmers with less than 10 acres of land as most of the lands are rain-fed in Telangana. Economists have argued that farmers with ten acres of land are known as semi-medium farmers who need support from the government. In fact, the proportion of benefit received by a small/marginal farmer is less compared to a large farmer thereby increasing the inequalities in terms of state aid.

As a result, every alternate day we hear of farmer suicides in one part of Telangana or the other although the administration is not coming out with truthful figures. To cite an example, a young farmer, P Kumara Swami, who owned two acres of land of Kothapalli village, Bheemadevarapalli mandal of Hanamkonda district committed suicide on February 9 by consuming pesticide as he was unable to repay the loans that he had taken.

Despite spending nearly one and a half lakh crore rupees in the last eight years in creating irrigation potential, the state government has failed to provide assured irrigation to many mandals, not even for one crop.

The way forward:

There should be a clear cut policy on addressing farmers’ issues, identification of beneficiaries for which a scientifically-evolved survey ought to be taken up, a small and marginal farmer-centric approach with necessary wherewithal, and spreading awareness on the need to continue cultivation.

A third party evaluation of schemes like Rythu Bandhu helps to undertake midcourse corrections and benefit the intended beneficiaries. Mere budget allocations do not make any impact on farming. It should be useful, feasible and implemented with modalities and standard operating procedures.

Climate Change.
It may seem bizarre, but climate change does contribute to deepening poverty, displacing population, and quick deterioration of resources.
UN figures show that 80% of the people displaced in the world by climate change are women.","Women are the worst sufferers of climate change. It is not an ‘Amrit Kaal' for them as they still have to toil hard

There is no planet B. Period. There can’t be a plan B either, where the climate crisis is concerned. Nature and its resources are limited and there is no way where we could ever outsource them. No resources, no plan B. A model of climate change on the computer and big talks and red flags will not help either. Globally, we are reaching a place where climate change will soon stop becoming a threat to it becoming a reality. It is no longer distant. It is here and is for real. And it exists on this very planet. Climate Change. Catch it if you can.

From melting glaciers to burning forests, rising sea levels, worsening floods, blizzards, ice storms, cyclones, droughts, pollution, sinking cities, and Changing seasons- the earth is running a fever. Global temperatures have increased. Mark Twain said, 'Climate is what you expect, and Weather is what you get.’ According to reports, Asia is on the verge of extreme heat, rising sea levels, growing losses from severe water, and increasing food insecurity in coming decades as climate change raises temperatures and alters weather patterns across the globe.

India is hyper-diverse in terms of its natural habitats, biodiversity, and socio-cultural ethos. With over a few billion people, we need to conserve our biodiversity and ensure human well-being. And we need to worry about it. The deadly heat waves indicate we need to become serious. Given the country’s large coastline, the sea level rise could become a disaster. Poor air quality is not only an urban problem but a rural one too. This gloomy blanket of air pollution has also clouded the vision of the Government at the helm. Just like the cracks that not only seem to have affected the state of Uttarakhand, because of digging for a project, there are some cracks in the system and its already fragmented and unclear policies as well.

While our Prime Minister and the Bharatiya Janata Party talk about development and Sabka Vikas, the untold truth is that we have destroyed our climate and our green cover for the sake of this ‘Vikas’ and ‘New India’. A lot of noise is being made around ‘Har Ghar Jal’, but the reality is flimsy and is building castles in the air. Prime Minister Narendra Modi-led union government only makes flimsy promises for environment restoration but, there is hardly any fund released for the same.

Our rural women still do not have access to clean tap water at home. They walk miles, away from her home and comfort zone, to ensure her household does not run dry of water. The rivers are drying up. The water reservoirs are empty. ‘Amrit Sarovars’ certainly do not have any ‘Water’ left in them. I am happy that our Prime Minister is worried about our mothers and sisters suffering and choking in the kitchens due to fuelwood smoke. The Ujjawala Scheme promises to give them LPG Cylinders. But have we succeeded? Our mothers and sisters are happy only on the posters. The reality seems to be different.

With the consistent effort of the Telangana Government, the forest cover of the state increased by 7% while the national average was only 3%. Further, talking about Telangana, many measures have been single-handedly taken for the agricultural development of farmer welfare, especially that of marginal women farmers, by the BRS Government. The Government under the leadership of Chief Minister K. Chandrashekhar Rao has speedily completed the Kaleshwaram Project and provided irrigation water to make Telangana an acre farm, rehabilitating ponds through Mission Kakatiya, increasing the water storage capacity, raising the groundwater level, and implementing schemes like 24-hour free electricity supply to farmers. In the year 2014-15 we had 1 Crore 31 Lakh Acres, and by the year 2021-22 2 Crore 04 Lakh Acres i.e., 70 Lakh Acres of new cultivation and cultivable land.

Mission Kakatiya is an innovative program undertaken by the Government of Telangana to restore water resources. Most of the lands supporting the ponds have been brought under cultivation by rehabilitating the chain ponds and removing the silts, the groundwater capacity has increased and the water in the wells and boreholes has increased and is useful for double crop cultivation. Around 15 lakh Ayakattu have been fixed. The government has spent Rs.5,000 crores. Through Mission Kakatiya, the government has taken measures to divert water from large and medium-scale projects to rehabilitated ponds and make the ponds full spheres with full water storage even in the dry season.

Rising issues about individuals' mental and emotional health have also become a looming concern. The pandemic has only made us aware of prevailing gender-based violence, mental health, and physical abuse in families. It did not come with the pandemic, and, therefore, it will not recede with it. It is here because our surrounding environment is giving it a rise. The Central Government is taking a lot of pride in empowering the Nari Shakti. But this Nari Shakti is bearing the brunt of changing climate and the Government is not even ready to address that a problem like this exists. Let us not get into the game of numbers and data here, but the increasing crime rate, in BJP-ruled states, puts society at shame.

While climate change does not discriminate, its effects do. It may seem bizarre, but climate change does contribute to deepening poverty, displacing population, and quick deterioration of resources. These effects take a huge toll on women and girls. Just by talking about Green Growth, we do not achieve it. We need to work on the ground, with viable plans.

UN figures show that 80% of the people displaced in the world by climate change are women. India is no different. This is a special year for India as we lead the G20 nations with Presidency. If we are not able to make strong, concrete efforts now, we will never be able to reverse the damage done. The time is now to act, to make our environment and climate safer for our mothers and sisters. This would then be the real ‘New India’, the ‘Amrit Kaal’ for our motherland.

Is there a pattern in Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s agriculture-related announcements in the Budget 2023-24? There is a thrust of nudging farmers towards cultivation of high value crops. This is evident from the outlay of ₹2,200 crore for making quality and disease-free planting material of horticultural crops available to them. As India prospers, it will consume more fruits and vegetables. The focus on high-value horticulture is apt.

There is a ₹6,000 crore scheme for value addition in fisheries. This is a sector that has grown by an average of 7% annually and contributes 6.7% to agricultural GVA (Gross Value Added). As people become prosperous, they consume less of cereals and more of proteins. So the thrust on fisheries meshes with the changes in consumption patterns.

Digital infra for agriculture can be force multiplier – but no allocation

The Finance Minister has also emphasised digital infrastructure for agriculture. This builds on the success of digital payments that ride on Aadhar identification, mobile internet, and the proliferation of no-frill bank accounts. Digital technologies can be a force multiplier in agriculture. They can help in dissemination of agronomic information and practices, monitoring of crop health, estimation of crop acreage and output, analysis of soil composition, agricultural marketing, and in making inputs, credit and insurance accessible. But the finance minister has made no allocation. She has promised an agriculture accelerator fund for agritech start-ups. The Economic Survey says there are more than a thousand of them. Again, no allocation has been made.

Focus on extra-long staple fibre cotton perplexing

Some announcements are quite perplexing. The Finance Minster wants to raise the productivity and output of extra-long staple fibre cotton. India is not a large producer of this variety. It’s of Egyptian origin and is susceptible to pests and diseases, C D Mayee, former Director of the Central Institute of Cotton Research, says the variety is grown in some pockets of Tamil Nadu and Telangana. In 2021-22, India imported 231,000 tonnes of raw cotton valued at $386 million, which presumably includes extra-long staple fibre cotton. But India also exported a larger quantity – 1.26 million tonnes – of raw cotton worth $2.8 billion. The cotton whose production the FM wants to promote is not a major import item.

Focus on millets (‘Shree Anna’) is welcome

Sitharaman’s focus on millets is welcome. She calls it ‘Shree Anna’. The rebranding is required because millets were called coarse grains as they are slow to digest and were the staple of the poor. But they are nutritious and have been called nutri-cereals. Since at least 2016, Karnataka has been selling them under the ‘Siri’ (meaning rich) brand. Millets are preferred by urban consumers with lifestyle diseases like diabetes. But they are an acquired taste. The FM wants to make India a global hub for millets. It is already the largest producer. Does she want production and productivity to rise substantially? For that, a big marketing thrust is needed. Innovative millet products will also have to be crafted.

The productivity will have to be raised from an average of 2.24 tonnes per hectare. And the area under cultivation will have to expand as demand rises. India produces an average of 48 million tonnes of millets, which is a fifth of the combined production of rice and wheat. But the FM has not made any allocation for these objectives. All she has said is that the millet research institute in Hyderabad will be supported.

Millets are of course socially useful. They use less water. If the government procures them on an assured basis, it will be ensuring inclusive development because millets are grown in dryland areas by small-holder farmers.

Millets can mitigate impact of climate change

The promotion of millets is also necessary to mitigate the impact of climate change. As water becomes scarcer, we need to grow crops that are rich in nutrition but use less water. But a larger emphasis on climate smart agriculture is missing. India needs to promote technologies that avert tractor emissions with no or low-till agriculture. We need to reduce water use in rice transplanting by seeding rice directly, rather than raising the seedling in nurseries and transplanting them. Micro irrigation, crop rotation, and crop diversification are necessary.

We also need new-age seeds that have technology embedded in them and can deliver high output while tolerating prolonged dry spells, flooding and salinity, and needing lesser inputs. We need plants that can repel insects or be toxic to them without harming humans, animals, and the environment. All this calls for increased outlay on research and development. Sadly, the FM has raised the outlay for the department of agricultural research and education by just ₹800 crore to ₹9,500 crore.

India needs sustainable intensification

Sitharaman pays ideological homage to natural farming. About 10 million farmers will be trained in natural farming, she says. We know what happened in Sri Lanka when it forsook chemical fertilisers and decided to be the first wholly-organic agri-producer in the world. Its agricultural production collapsed. Natural farming is land-intensive. It is also low- yielding. It has a niche. It is meant for fastidious consumers who can be choosy about food and pay premium prices for them. It cannot feed a country with a growing population and shrinking cultivable land.

BK Jha from Biharigarh in Uttarakhand

Biharigarh in Uttarakhand, near the state capital Dehradun, is a sleeping small town surrounded by villages where people are mainly engaged in farming activities. On Tuesday (February 28) farmers of the area woke up to witness a remarkable transformation that is scheduled to take place in the year which is known as the International Year of Millets (IYM 2023). Local people here witnessed the formal beginning of the life-changing agro-business project as the top management and experts team of Ivar Agro gathered here to formally announce the start of the work and held a stakeholder meeting to speed up the works at the project site.

With an initial investment of Rs 200 crore, Ivar Agro would be setting up a state-of-the-art millet-based food products project which would also provide large-scale employment to local people. Ivar Agro’s millet-based products like Bajra Biscuits and Cookies, along with other items are expected to hit domestic and international markets during festive seasons in 2023 (IYM).

“Ivar Agro is a new business venture aimed at providing healthy and sustainable food options to the people of India. Our primary focus is on millet-based products, and we plan to start with the production of millet biscuits. With 1,000 tonnes monthly production capacity, the company aims to empower millet growers of the country by providing them with an opportunity to be our partners in the large-scale production of millet-based food items,” says Vijay Gupta, Founder and Managing Director, Ivar Agro Manufacturing who had conceptualised the project before the outbreak of COVID-19 and subsequently acquired nearly 15 acres in Bihargarh to launch a farmer-centric project.

In 2022, India made efforts to get 2023 recognised as the International Year of Millets by the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). In India, millets are grown as a Kharif crop, requiring less water and other agricultural inputs than other staples. The millets commonly grown in India include Jowar (sorghum), Bajra (pearl millet), Ragi (finger millet), Jhangora (barnyard millet), Barri (Proso or common millet), Kangni (foxtail/ Italian millet), and Kodra (Kodo millet).

In her Budget Speech, Union Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said, “India is the global hub for millets or Shri Anna. India is at the forefront of popularising millet whose consumption furthers nutrition, food security and welfare of farmers.” She referred to Millets as Shri Anna.

“Our project would be aligned with the government’s initiative to promote millet growers and food products based on it. Our modern automated machines will be well integrated from raw materials to finished items. The project aims to generate livelihoods, increase farmers’ income, and contribute to food and nutritional security. Initially, 200 workers- skilled and semiskilled- would be working in two shifts and as our capacity increases, we would able to provide huge direct and indirect employment opportunities. Over 75 per cent of our workforce would come from local areas,” added Vijay Gupta.

India is the largest producer and second-largest exporter of Shri Anna in the world. The production of millets has increased from 14.52 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 17.96 million tonnes in 2020-21. The production of bajra has also increased from 8.07 million tonnes to 10.86 million tonnes during the same period.

“With the government’s promotional policies and incentives, we are very hopeful that other than current millet growing states- Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana- other states including Uttarakhand and Uttar Pradesh would also go for it. Hence, there will be no concern about the availability of raw materials. In a phased manner, Ivar Agro would increase its capacity to meet the growing domestic and international demand,” expounds Krishna Gupta, Director and CEO, Ivar Agro.

Millets are nutrient-rich grains that are well-suited to India’s climate and soil conditions and are an important crop for small and marginal farmers. However, due to factors such as low demand, lack of infrastructure, and limited market access, millet cultivation has declined in recent years, leaving many farmers struggling to make ends meet.

“We are very enthusiastic and hopeful that by establishing a millet-based food product project, there can be an increase in demand for millet-based products such as millet flour, millet flakes, and millet-based snacks-biscuits and cookies. This increase in demand can result in better prices for millet farmers, as well as greater income security,” underpins Dhananjay Gupta, Director and COO, of Ivar Agro.

Ivar Agro aims to create employment opportunities in Biharigarh. Going forward, for backward linkage, it also plans to provide training and support to millet growers, helping them improve the quality of their crops, adopt sustainable farming practices, and connect with markets.

“Large-scale production can further promote the consumption of millets, which are a healthy and sustainable alternative to processed and refined grains. This can improve the health and nutrition outcomes of consumers, as well as support sustainable food systems,” concludes Vijay Gupta.

The declaration has allowed the Indian government to take the lead in celebrating IYM 2023. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has made it clear that he wants to use the opportunity to make the event a “People’s Movement” and make India the “Global Hub for Millets.” With Ivar Agro’s project, the people of Biharigarh would be able to boast of becoming the frontrunner in this movement.

Andhra Pradesh (AP), comprising 26 districts, has three agro-ecological regions—the Adivasi belt of the north, the prosperous coastal plains, and the rain-shadow area of Rayalaseema.

North AP, which has hilly terrain and high rainfall, is suitable for commercial crops such as ginger, turmeric, coffee, and black pepper. In coastal AP, known as Annapurna or the land of plentiful food, households can grow three or four crops a year. Farmers in this region focus on commercial crops and use large quantities of pesticides and fertilisers; they are also highly entrepreneurial. Rayalaseema, on the other hand, receives scanty rain, and agriculture here is not a secure profession. A large number of farmers from this region migrate to cities for jobs.

As with the rest of the country, several migrants in the pockets of Anantapur, Chittoor, Kurnool, and Kadapa, among others, returned to their villages during the pandemic. Madanapalli Bhakhtar Vali, regional head at Foundation for Ecological Security (FES)—a nonprofit that works on strengthening and conserving land, forest, and water resources—says everyone worked on MNREGA schemes during the first wave. “It didn’t matter what educational or social background people came from; it didn’t matter what they were doing earlier. Everyone— students, drivers, farmers who had never done MNREGA work before—benefited from the scheme.”

According to Vali, this helped break the social and economic hierarchies in villages for that time. “Since the pandemic had upturned all rules and all livelihoods, no one cared about whether it was ‘good’ work or not. Moreover, since this was a government-driven scheme, people didn’t feel obligated to anyone,” he says.

The surplus labour in the villages also offered an opportunity to bring all cultivable land into agriculture. As there was a shortage of money to invest in agriculture, people worked on some form of barter system—exchanging labour and working on each other’s lands on sowing, transplanting, harvesting, and so on.

The economic profile of the farmer has changed

Farmers who have say two to three acres of land do not rely on farming alone; instead, they have multiple sources of livelihood. They own livestock such as sheep, goats, cows, and buffaloes that provide milk and meat. They also work for daily wages on other people’s farms, and on MNREGA schemes. In essence, a household earns from agriculture, livestock, MNREGA, and other agriculture wage employment. Vali says it is crucial that policymakers understand the changed profile of farmers to help them raise incomes and build sustainable lives.

Farmers realise that doing just agriculture is not viable any more.

How farmers look at food security has also changed. They don’t cultivate just the crops needed to feed their families; instead, they prefer to grow cash crops they can sell in the market. Farmers realise that doing just agriculture is not viable any more, Vali adds. “They need money to pay for their children’s education, their families’ health, and to construct their homes. Everything they do with their land is based on how much income they can generate to realise their aspirations.”

Shaik Anwar, head of AP and Telangana at Azim Premji Foundation, describes a typical scenario. “Usually, farmers who have a small piece of land close to water sources prefer to grow paddy there for their own household consumption. On the rest of the land, they grow one of the commercial crops that suits the local ecology and that they can sell for surplus income. This gives them cash in hand. It’s not much—INR 5,000–7,000 per month per acre—but it allows them to buy other necessities. If a farmer has more land, they will have more income,” he says.

However, a farmer’s ability to do farming viably is also affected by climate change and market linkages.

Climate change is destroying farmer confidence

Rains in AP (as in the rest of the country) have increasingly become erratic. As a result, there is no security of crop and, hence, no food or income security for farmers.

For instance, Anantapur district used to be the second most drought-prone district in the country and would receive only 550 m rain a year. In the past two years, however, it has received excellent rainfall and every tank in its villages has surplus water. Contrary to popular belief, the impact of these good rains has not resulted in better crop yields or incomes. The farmers’ confidence in agriculture is dipping. Anwar says, “They can no longer predict when to sow or what unseasonal rains will do to their crops; the rainfall and cropping patterns no longer match and the risk is too high.” Vali says, “Losing a crop means losing a season; losing a season means losing a year; losing a year means losing their livelihood.”

Despite this, Vali adds, most farmers are using their experience and expertise, their traditional and new knowledge—everything in their capacity—to produce better. But they also know that their fortunes are decided by the market, over which too they have no control.

Markets are not farmer-friendly

There is a huge variation in the money the farmer receives and the prices at retail shops, mandis, and farm gates. Vali says that the younger farmers see the final prices at shops and malls. “They are looking to grow crops that urban customers consume—millets, fruits, and vegetables. But the difference between the retail price and what the farmer earns is so big that they find it frustrating. For instance, in 2019, when millets were selling at INR 82 per kg in the malls, farmers were receiving only INR 22 per kg.”

He reiterates how the market continues to be exploitative. “When a cyclone makes it difficult for farmers to pluck fruits or vegetables, we can expect a jump in prices for the end consumer. But even when there is no cyclone, prices are high in city markets. Farmers don’t get the benefit of these prices. This puzzles them—they believe their incomes are left completely to luck.” Because of the way farmer producer organisations (FPOs) are structured, they have no financial clout in the market and are unable to help farmer members bridge this vast gap.

Farmers are moving to natural farming

Farmers in AP are seeking to improve the things they do have control over—soil, crop quality, and yields. Through the years, they put in increasingly stronger doses of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and used the highest quality seeds for better yields. This didn’t generate more income, but the fertilisers and pesticides polluted the soil to the extent that it lost its regenerative capacity.

Several farmers are gradually migrating to natural farming methods.

Given this deterioration, several farmers are gradually migrating to natural farming (NF) methods. The AP government has been promoting NF since 2016. With support from Azim Premji Foundation, it set up an independent institute—the Rythu Sadhikara Samstha (RySS). In six years, RySS has worked with 6.3 lakh farmers on NF (the state has an estimated 60 lakh farmers). Given the focus on NF in the state, several other nonprofits are also working on the shift from fertiliser- and chemical-pesticide-centric farming to natural farming and non-chemical approaches.

Organisations such as RySS, APF, WASSAN, Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Jattu Trust, and Accion Fraterna Ecology Centre invest time in helping farmers make this transition and in building their confidence.

According to Vali, there are three categories of farmers. The first are instantly attracted to the idea and start immediately. The second will not change their mindset even if you show them evidence. “The third group is the one with potential—if they see that the new model can benefit them, they are willing to try it. They still have some fear because it is different from what they are used to,” he says.

Anwar says that in the past five years, he has seen that farmers start with a small area to grow crops. “Over time, as they gain confidence, they expand these practices to cover all their land.”

He adds, “A substantial proportion of farmers pick several NF practices, thereby reducing pesticide usage significantly. They do, however, retain the option of applying chemicals at the last minute. We consider them partial converts. A second category don’t apply any chemical fertilisers or pesticides. We call them seed-to-seed farmers. Half of the six lakh farmers who practice NF through RySS fall in this category. Many them are from north coastal AP, which has a high Adivasi population.”

Some challenges remain

1. Lack of ownership and confidence

Several large landowners in coastal AP have moved away from agriculture and have been leasing land mostly through informal mechanisms. There is a lot of tenancy cropping among smaller, more marginalised farmers in these areas. Since it is not their land, their sense of ownership is limited. “If you are a farmer who owns the land and lives off it, you will think of soil health, of keeping the land sustainable. There should be new ways of engagement between the landowning community and tenant farmers in order to improve soil health,” explains Anwar.

2. Lack of imagination

The bigger problem is of imagination. The general refrain among farmers is that they have to invest a lot upfront for organic agriculture and there will be reduction in yields. Studies have shown that there is no yield penalty for switching to NF. However, farmers continue to think of farming as high investment and risk.

For traditional farming, they need to borrow money to pay for market inputs. For instance, for one tomato crop, a farmer has to invest INR 1.5 lakh per acre. They need to pay for seeds, fertilisers, and pesticides. Wages have also increased, and there is competition among farmers for this labour. To counter these challenges, many farmers are shifting from paddy and cereals to horticulture. “They are choosing to grow fruits as these are less labour-intensive and require less water,” Vali says.

Anwar says that, earlier, farmers did not know it was possible to do more with less. “When they don’t have to invest large amounts upfront in NF, their dependency on moneylenders also decreases.”

Crop security is central to the NF model. “We don’t want farmers to depend on only one crop. They should have a diversified portfolio. We design crop patterns in such a way that harvest income is steady for almost 10 months of the year. This, however, works best for small farmers,” says Anwar.

The next generation is not interested in farming

According to Vali, aspirations around education, health, housing, and celebrations are growing, and income from farming isn’t enough to pay for these. The next generation isn’t interested in agriculture because they don’t believe it has a future.

The youth is not interested in farming, particularly in tribal areas.

Anwar also says that the youth is not interested in farming, particularly in tribal areas. “They don’t want to do agriculture like their parents; their education is not enough to get them a decent job since they are unable to compete with urban youth in terms of market skills.”

However, he believes that there are entrepreneurial opportunities to be built around sustainable farming. NF, at scale, sets up demand for new inputs such as biopesticides, natural soil stimulants, value addition, and marketing. As the number of NF farmers increases, the demand for these inputs will provide an opportunity for local youth to offer these products and services.

Hyderabad: In recent times there has been discussion on the idea of levying income tax on farmers’ income. Bibek Debroy, Chairman of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, raised the issue in an article in The New Indian Express on January 21 titled ‘The Necessity of Taxing Farmers’ Income in India’.

Given the existing conditions of the economy, when the contribution of agriculture in terms of share of total gross value added (GVA) is as low as 15%, and around 46% of the workforce is engaged in the sector, this is unreasonable. Debroy quoted Wilson, who was influenced by England’s agricultural system, where actual cultivators were capitalist tenant farmers, leasing land from the landlords. The capitalist farmers used to pay taxes to the government and also rent to the landlord (Marx, Vol III).

Similarly, the British East India Company imposed a landlord system in India through permanent settlement in Eastern India. It is contextual to discuss the KN Raj Committee on taxation of agricultural income firstly, and then the rationality in the proposition of levying ‘agricultural income tax’ on farmers.

KN Raj Committee

In February 1972, the Committee on Taxation of Agricultural Wealth and Income was set up under the chairmanship of Prof KN Raj. The economic situation then was quite different in a few ways:

. Direct taxes contributed just over 20% to the total tax revenue, and as a consequence, the dependence on indirect taxes (ie, taxes on commodities and services) was to the extent of around 80%

. India’s economy was dependent on agriculture, which contributed over 60% to the total GVA, ie, to India’s GDP

. Two wars (with China in 1962 and with Pakistan in 1965), and the death of two Prime Ministers in 1964 and 1966, led to a Plan holiday for the Fourth Five Year Plan, and in their place, three Annual Plans (1966-67, 1967-68 and 1968-69) came up. Further, the land ceilings implemented in the mid-60s became a farce, which caused rural turmoil against large landowners/landlords culminating in the Naxalite movement (May 1967). The big landowning classes dominated the legislative Assemblies and Parliament; and thus, ceilings on land ownership were a futile exercise. In addition to this, by 1972-73, the terms of trade were in favour of agriculture by 50% against the non-farm sector (Ashok Mitra, 1979).

. Indira Gandhi, who became Prime Minister on January 24, 1966, had to agree to devalue the rupee by more than 30% in 1966, and adopt import liberalisation so that exports in the industrial sector would end industrial stagnation (Raj, 1976). The proposal by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) was already conveyed in October 1965 in her predecessor’s government. Further, USAID imposed a condition to devalue the rupee for exporting chemical fertilizers from the US (Raj, 1966).

Rising Direct Taxes

The Raj Committee report considered the fact that the bulk of the additions to tax revenue in India during the 1950s and 1960s had come from indirect taxation, and indirect taxes would continue to have an important role in the fiscal system.

But the situation has changed over the period. The share of direct taxes which was 22.75% in 1974-75, gradually went up. From one-fifth, it rose to over two-fifths by the time the UPA government came to power. The UPA regime, under the influence of supply-side economics, guided by the economist Arthur Laffer’s argument that reduction in tax rates increases tax revenue, reduced the number of slabs along with reduced rates in direct taxes. Such reduction brought good results too. The percentage share of direct taxes in total tax revenue increased from 42.7 in 2004-05, reaching a peak of 56 in 2008-09. It was 55.4 in 2014-15. Thereafter, it went on sliding from 47.6% in 2015-16, reached a peak of 54.9% in 2018-19, and settled at 47.5% in 2022-23.

Share in GVA Smaller

The Raj Commission also noted that though the need for taxation of agriculture was necessary for a country like India which was mostly agricultural in character; the form and incidence of such taxation would depend on the political structure and the objectives of economic policy, as KN Raj said in his Ramaswami Memorial Lecture, delivered on March 12, 1973.

But now the situation is different. In 2011-12 constant prices, the share of agriculture (crops+livestock+forestry+fishing) was as high as 60.7% in the total GVA in 1950-51. It was at its lowest level of 14.8% in 2018-19, and is estimated to stay at 16.3% in 2020-21. (see infographics). During the pandemic, when all sectors turned negative, only agriculture performed well with around 3.5% growth rate. Overall, for the 71 years period from 1950-51 to 2020-21, agricultural GVA grew at 2.71%, while the total GVA grew at 4.91%.

Cost and Climate

There has been a rising tendency in input cost expenditures on seeds, chemical fertilizers and pesticides since liberalisation, privatisation and globalisation (LPG) policies of 1991 on the one hand, and adoption of export-oriented crops after the WTO came into existence in 1995, on the other.

Further, climate change too is having a tremendous adverse impact on Indian agriculture with the occurrence of more untimely cyclones and depressions, causing heavy rains, and floods, along with long, dry spells and drought situations leading to crop failures and losses, and suicides. The National Crime Records Bureau recorded that 3,61,970 farmers’ suicides occurred during 1995-2021.

Michael Shafi reported in The Guardian, on July 31, 2017, that in India, climate change also might have contributed to the suicides of nearly 60,000 Indian farmers and farm workers over the past three decades.

Swaminathan Commission

The most important problem is that the farmer cannot fix the price of the agricultural produce just as any other commodity producer or service provider. Hence, the demand for mandatory MSP. The Swaminathan Committee in its report National Commission on Farmers, 2006 recommended: “The Minimum Support Price (MSP) should be at least 50% more than the weighted average cost of production. The ‘net take home income’ of farmers should be comparable to those of civil servants”.

Land Holdings and Tax

The second phase of land ceilings of the mid-70s and the population growth led to the fragmentation of land holdings. In 2012-13, as per NSS report No. 571, households that own land >= 4 ha stood at 3.386 million and they own 22.760 million hectares, which works out to be an average land of 6.721 ha per household. If we go by household operational holdings, which was preferred by KN Raj (1972 and 1973) for Agricultural Holdings Tax: in 2012-13, there were 3.710 million households operating 23.951 million hectares — average land of 6.457 ha per household.

In 2012-13, 7.41% of rural households did not own any land, 75.41% households owned 29.75% of land, in the size class of 0.002-1.000 ha, with average land of 0.234 ha/household. Similarly, in respect of household operational holdings, 73.17% households operated 27.71% of land, in the size class of 0.002-1.000 ha, with average land of 0.329 ha/household. Further, in the total rural households, neither owning nor operating households accounted for 5.95%, while those owning but not operating land stood at 24.36%. Thus, 30.31% of rural households in total were not operating land in 2012-13.

Assessing Agri Income Tax

Administrative difficulties arise in assessing agricultural income tax with regard to two important issues: the first relates to taking a farmer as a unit or his family as a unit, and the second relates to the size of the farm and its potential/real productivity.

With regard to the first issue, the Raj Commission adopted the nuclear family as a unit: “For purposes of direct taxation, it is our view that the nuclear family — consisting of husband, wife and minor children — is the appropriate basic unit for assessment. … For administrative reasons also the family has to be made the basic unit for assessment of direct taxes if large-scale evasion through splitting of incomes between family members is to be avoided”.

Addressing the second issue, the Raj commission’s suggestions were:

. Operational holdings and potential productivity have to be chosen for the assessment of income tax. The determination of potential productivity is very difficult, because of the different properties of soil, availability of water and climatic conditions

. It is obvious that the objective conditions that have to be taken into account in assessing potential productivity may differ to such an extent that the methods suggested in one set of circumstances may not seem appropriate or reasonable in another situation. Any scheme of taxation of this kind, therefore, has to have within it sufficient flexibility to be adapted to the requirements of each case.

. As regards the size, there is no specific size or cut-off point for choosing the farm size, the Commission had given some methods. But in the present condition, nearly 75-80% of operational holdings are below 1 hectare (2.5 acre nearly). Around 86% of holdings are those of small and marginal farmers operating below 2 hectares. Moreover, the tenancy is unreported and tenancy is not assured. Tenancy laws act as a deterrent to marginal and small land owners to give written agreements for the fear of conferment of rights to the tenants.

The government of India appointed a committee on tenancy headed by T Haque, and the Report of the Expert Committee on Land Leasing (2016) prepared a Model Act of Tenancy. As per its provisions, a lease agreement may be either registered under the Registration Act or attested by the village revenue officer or sarpanch or a notary, but it shall not create or confer any right over the land on the lessee cultivator. Such protection to land owners may encourage open tenancy.

Way back, KN Raj also considered various administrative problems that might be difficult to overcome in practice to organise and operate effectively the agricultural holdings tax. The problems faced include: non-availability of records relating to operational holdings, difficulties in demarcating tracts and areas that are broadly homogeneous with respect to soil and climate, burden that would be imposed on the administrative machinery if the assessments have to be made annually, and difficulties posed by the existence of ‘benami’ holdings.

The government of India had proposed to double farmers’ income by 2022 but we are yet to realise it. Proposals such as tax on “farmers’ income” seem to be countering the government’s intention and is certainly a regressive idea in the current context.

Instead, it has addressed specific areas, not all of which are pressure points.

This is the international year of millets. India is the largest producer of these socially-useful crops which are not only nutritious but also low in water use. The emphasis on millets is welcome from both a climate change perspective and from the point of view of inclusive growth as they are grown in dryland areas by small and marginal farmers.

Currently, the country produces about 50 million tonnes of millet, which is about a fifth of the combined production of rice and wheat. They are known as coarse cereals. But about six years ago, Karnataka rebranded them as “Siri” or rich to position them as those in urban areas suffering from lifestyle diseases like diabetes.

No monetary allocation for millet production

The finance minister in her speech referred to millets as Shree Anna. She has said that the Indian Institute of Millet Research, Hyderabad will be developed as a centre of excellence. But she has not made a monetary allocation. Millets need action on the demand and supply fronts. Production must be responsive to increased demand. Currently, their average productivity is low at about 1.3 tonnes per hectare. They also do not have a long shelf life.

Outlay for horticulture, a good move

The Rs 2,200 crore allocation for making available quality and disease-free planting material for high-value horticulture crops is a good move. Horticultural crops are much more paying than cereal crops. The allocation is also aligned with the increased consumption of fruits and vegetables.

The Rs 6,000 crore allocation for value-addition in the fisheries sector gels with the government’s thrust on it. Fisheries have grown annually at 7 percent and contribute 6.7 percent of total agricultural GVA.

Curious announcement on PPP for cotton fibre

The Budget’s promised support for enhancing the productivity of extra-long staple fibre cotton by adopting a value chain and cluster approach in public-private partnership (PPP) is rather curious. India is not a big producer of Egyptian cotton as it is prone to pest and disease attacks. The hybrid is grown on a limited scale in Tamil Nadu and Telangana. Again, there is no allocation.

Mission Mustard needed, but not announced

One would have expected the finance minister to launch something like Mission Mustard given the country’s dependence on imported edible oil. This would have meshed with the oil palm mission launched in August 2021. Among oilseeds, mustard has the largest oil content of 37-42 percent. In 2018, the Solvent Extractors’ Association (the grouping of edible oil processors) urged the government to launch Mission Mustard in Punjab and Haryana by incentivising the displacement of some areas under wheat.

No allocation announced for agri-startups

Building on the success of digital payments, the government says it will support digital public infrastructure in agriculture for crop planning, output estimation, assessment of plant health, and improved access to farm inputs, credit, and insurance. An agriculture accelerator fund for agri-start-ups has been promised but no allocation has been made.

Natural farming is a fad

There is also the customary – ideological – homage paid to natural farming. About one crore farmers will be trained in natural farming, the finance minister said. Natural farming is a fad. What we need is sustainable intensification with judicious use of chemical fertilisers and the adoption of earth-friendly cultivation practices.

The finance minister also did not make bold and elaborate on a policy change that we saw last year with the government easing the regulations for genome-editing technologies, and the approval of genetically-modified mustard, the first GM food crop.

No allocation for agri R&D

My annual grouse about the agriculture budget remains the low allocation for agricultural research and development (R&D). This year’s Budget allocation for the department of agricultural research and education is Rs 9,500 cr – about Rs 800 cr more than last year. The outlay for the agriculture ministry is Rs 1.16 lakh cr, about Rs 5,000 cr more than the revised estimates for 2022-23. With the fertiliser subsidy outlay of Rs 1.75 lakh cr and Rs 60,000 cr outlay for PM-Kisan (the annual payment of Rs 6,000 per farming family), there is little public investment in agriculture. Little wonder, that private investment, mainly by households, accounts for 84 percent of the total capital investment in agriculture.

India seems to be on the right path and is doing pretty well — especially when compared to its progress in the first six decades after 1947.

No wonder, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has termed the next 25 years, when India completes 100 years of Independence, as Amrit Kaal.

There are two issues that we want to focus on. First, how inclusive is this growth, and second, how sustainable it is likely to be, especially from an environmental standpoint, given that climate change is already knocking on our doors.

Also by Ashok Gulati | How Gautam Adani can help save the environment and increase farmers’ income

We measure inclusiveness by looking at the record of the laggard states, especially the so-called BIMARU states (Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh), and also the performance of the agricultural sector that engages the largest share of workforce — 46.5 per cent in 2020-21. It is well-known that with development, the workforce moves out of agriculture to higher productivity jobs in urban areas, especially in the construction of new cities and the infrastructure required to run these urban centres. More than half the world’s population today lives in cities, though India is still roughly two-thirds rural. In the next 25 years, the country’s focus should be on infrastructure construction, including in rural areas, and skilling a large mass of the working population for higher productivity jobs. The Union budget of 2023-24 has done well on this account, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman deserves to be complimented for that.

Let us now look at the performance of GDP at the state level — their agriculture sectors in particular — over the period 2005-06 to 2021-22, for which we could get the latest data at the state level from MOSPI. This period saw both the UPA and NDA governments at the Centre. At the state level too, different parties occupied office.

Also in Express Opinion | Girish Kuber writes: Election Commission’s endorsement of Eknath Shinde-led Shiv Sena may hurt the BJP more than it helps

The infographic shows that the country averaged a GDP growth of 6.7 per cent per annum in this period and its agri GDP growth stood at 3.8 per cent per annum. This is satisfying, though not as outstanding as China’s performance. Of all the major states, Gujarat topped the list in overall GDP growth at 8.9 per cent closely followed by Uttarakhand (8.7 per cent), Telangana (8.6 per cent) and Haryana (8 per cent). At the bottom of this list were Jammu and Kashmir (5.2 per cent), Assam (5.4 per cent), West Bengal (5.5 per cent), Uttar Pradesh (5.6 per cent) and Jharkhand (5.7 per cent).

To analyse how inclusive this growth has been, we look at the agri-GDP growth in BIMARU states. Madhya Pradesh has performed very well — it has clocked the highest growth rate in agriculture at 7.3 per cent. Its overall GDP growth is a respectable 7.5 per cent. The state’s agri-GDP growth is way above the all India agri-GDP growth and the state is a shining example of doubling the contribution of horticulture in its value of agriculture and allied sector.

MP has made its mark as a top-notch player in tomato, garlic, mandarin oranges, pulses (especially gram) and soyabean cultivation. Pulses and oilseeds fix nitrogen and use very little water, saving on fertiliser and power subsidies, and ensuring environmental sustainability. MP is also the second-largest producer of wheat (after UP), and the third-largest milk producer after UP and Rajasthan. It is following a well-diversified portfolio in agriculture while doubling irrigation coverage from 24 to 45.3 per cent of its gross cropped area over the last two decades. MP is the only state whose agriculture contribution to overall GDP has increased to 40 per cent, as against 18.8 percent at the all-India level — its model should aptly be described as inclusive and sustainable.

Amongst other BIMARU states, Rajasthan has also done well in agriculture recording an annual average growth rate of 5.7 per cent, followed by UP and Bihar with 4.5 per cent and 4.4 per cent respectively.

Two other states need special mention — Jharkhand and Punjab. Jharkhand carved out of Bihar in 2000, has performed exceptionally well in agriculture with a growth rate of 6.4 per cent per annum, largely driven by diversification towards horticulture and livestock. In contrast, the Green Revolution champion Punjab hasn’t done well. Its agri-GDP growth was a meagre 2 per cent per annum over this period.

Punjabis might well say that the state already has a high level of productivity in wheat and rice, and further higher growth in agriculture may not be feasible. With all humility, we must say that this is not correct (both of us are also proud Punjabis). If Punjab had diversified to high-value horticulture, or even some pulses and oilseeds, it would have registered higher agricultural growth and more importantly, saved precious groundwater and power subsidy. The methane and nitrous oxide emissions that ensue as a result of paddy cultivation could also have been much less. This is something for Punjab’s policymakers to pause and think about.

What are Geomagnetic storms?

A geomagnetic storm (magnetic storm) is a temporary disturbance of the Earth’s magnetosphere caused by a solar wind shock wave that interacts with the Earth’s magnetic field

The magnetosphere shields Earth from harmful solar particle radiation, as well as erosion of the atmosphere by the solar wind

Reason: These storms are generally associated with solar Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) where a billion tons or so of plasma from the sun, with its embedded magnetic field, arrives at Earth.

CMEs are large ejections of plasma and magnetic fields that originate from the Sun’s corona (outermost layer).

11,An Early Heatwave Warning: What does It Mean For India?,2023-03-01 15:36:44+05:30,['Hera Rizwan'],"['mean', 'crops', 'does', 'season', 'impact', 'el', 'sharma', 'nino', 'normal', 'early', 'india', 'heatwaves', 'weather', 'warning', 'heatwave']","This is a shift from the normal weather trend as the ""month of February starts with a normal of 23-degree celsius and closes with 25-26 degree celsius"", the report said.
Apart from northeast India and the coastal areas, the rest of India is susceptible to such conditions.
According to Sharma El Nino and La Nina are ocean-borne phenomena and are inverse of each other.
Speaking to BOOM, Deoras said, the last three years have been La Nina years, while 2023 is likely to be an El Nino year.
The El Nino effect will impact the southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon in India.","The India Meteorological Department (IMD) issued a warning, on February 20, that the maximum temperatures in that week would be 3-5° C higher than the long-term average. The warning was issued for northwest, west, and central India.

The national capital recorded its second hottest February day (31.5° C) in the last five years, according to The Skymet Weather report. This is a shift from the normal weather trend as the ""month of February starts with a normal of 23-degree celsius and closes with 25-26 degree celsius"", the report said.

Speaking to BOOM, AVM Sharma, president (Meteorology & Climate Change) of Skymet Weather, said that this year the heatwave has come early against the normal trend. ""We mostly recede the winters by February, but this time the shift has come early. Normally, the Indian Subcontinent experiences these waves in the pre-monsoon months, which are March, April, May and parts of June"".

What are heatwaves and how do they occur?

The National Disaster Management Authority of India defines a heatwave as ""a period of abnormally high temperatures, more than the normal maximum temperature that occurs during the summer season in the North-Western parts of India"". People who live in these areas are impacted by the extreme temperatures and accompanying atmospheric conditions as they cause physiological stress, which can also result in death.

According to Sharma, the dry spell during pre-monsoon causes heat to accumulate which gives rise to the heatwaves. ""Normally these dry spells are interrupted by the weather activities like rain, thunderstorm or hailstorms. In the absence of these phenomena, where the heat accumulates uninterrupted in the lower layers of the atmosphere, the pockets where these activities occur are pronounced as experiencing the heatwave"", he said. Apart from northeast India and the coastal areas, the rest of India is susceptible to such conditions. Enumerating the states vulnerable to heatwaves, Sharma said, ""Gujarat, Rajasthan, Odisha and interiors of the peninsula like Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, especially, experience such extreme conditions of weather.""

Explaining the early arrival of heatwaves in India this year, Akshay Deoras, a research scientist at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology, University of Reading, UK, said, ""The winds from the north-west push the heatwaves, originating in the Middle-East, towards India. Heatwaves need dry conditions for them to prevail and the absence of the western disturbances in northern India provides the apt scenario. And last year, there were no substantial western disturbances, in the month of November and December.""

What effects do the El Nino and La Nina currents have on heatwaves?

According to Sharma El Nino and La Nina are ocean-borne phenomena and are inverse of each other. The sea surface temperature in the Pacific Ocean dictates their formation. He said, ""The warming of sea surface temperature in the equatorial Pacific region by more than 0.5 degree celsius, in a persistent fashion causes the El Nino situation. The opposite of this situation, which is the dropping of sea surface temperature by a similar margin, causes the La Nina situation. These climate patterns in the Pacific Ocean are capable of affecting weather worldwide.""

Speaking to BOOM, Deoras said, the last three years have been La Nina years, while 2023 is likely to be an El Nino year. Explaining further about the phenomenon, he said that ""Each effect lasts mostly a year, as they alternate between each other, but sometimes they may last more than a year or two"". The El Nino effect will impact the southwest monsoon and northeast monsoon in India. It will increase the severity and magnitude of the heatwaves, Deoras added.

How can heatwaves affect India's economy?



Heatwaves in India can impact the economy because weather has a significant impact on agriculture. Around two-thirds of India's population is dependent on agriculture for a living.

According to Sharma, any weather condition which shifts from normal will impact crop production, be it rabi or kharif. The crops that are sown in the rainy season are called kharif crops (also known as the summer or monsoon crops) in India. Kharif crops are usually sown with the beginning of the first rains in July. The crops that are sown in the winter season are called rabi crops (also known as the winter crop). They are grown within the period of November to April.

Deoras said that the prevailing conditions were of concern as the winter season is shrinking and the summer season is being prolonged. This, he said, would affect sowing and reaping patterns in the agricultural sector. ""As this would be an El Nino year and the monsoon forecast is not that promising, this will affect the sowing of kharif crops. Hence, the output will not be as expected"", he said.

Elaborating on the effect of a heatwave on employment, Deoras explained, ""If we receive acute rainfall, especially in the key agriculture states of India, the employment rate will see a significant impact. As the crop output decreases, the profit margin will decrease which will lead to lesser people being employed on the fields. This would be a worse-case scenario but we cannot strike out its possibility.""

Heatwaves also impact labour productivity. According to a report by International Labour Organisation, labour productivity in the agriculture and construction sector will be the worst impacted during the heatwave. The country most affected by heat stress is India, which lost 4.3 per cent of working hours in 1995 and is projected to lose 5.8 per cent of working hours in 2030. Moreover, because of its large population, India is in absolute terms expected to lose the equivalent of 34 million full-time jobs in 2030 as a result of heat stress, the report read.",https://www.boomlive.in/h-upload/2023/03/01/999762-thermometer-with-a-record-high-temperature.jpg,[],https://www.boomlive.in/explainers/heat-wave-warning-india-impacts-21213

:

We have lost nutrition in the foods we eat since rice and wheat are considered as the only grains to address food insecurity in the country, stated Indian Institute of Millets Research director C.V. Ratnavathi.

Participating in the concluding ceremony of the 23rd edition of the annual Mobile Biodiversity Festival held at Machnoor village of Jharasangham mandal here on Saturday, Ms.Ratnavathi said women farmers of Deccan Development Society (DDS) are an inspiration to millet conservers across the country for their decades worth of effort. “The world is waking up to the importance of these neglected crops and their uses for human and planet health. The discussion about millets is now reaching global platforms like G20,” she said.

Additional Collector,G. Veera Reddy said Zaheerabad was earlier considered a wasteland with poor soil. However, DDS women have charted a separate identity for Zaheerabad, Sangareddy and even Medak as a hotspot for agro-biodiversity and heritage crops. “Conventional farming, which relies on mechanisation and irrigation, is increasing everywhere and the negative consequences are being neglected. We are glad that festivals like these are spreading the message on agro-biodiversity,” he said.

Eminent food and trade policy analyst Devinder Sharma said: “The agriculture of DDS women brings together the principles of food security, environmental conservation and livestock health. This is now offering solutions to modern crises like climate change. I hope your message is sent across the country and even globally as it is the need of the hour to realise the harm in neglecting millets. This rainfed agriculture of mixed millet cropping must become an important theme in global conferences like G20 which we are hosting this year.”

DDS director P.V. Satheesh said the festival commenced 23 years ago by sangham women as they took an initiative on their own to celebrate the festival in a grand way and contributed to its growth now. “Almost all DDS farmers have 2-3 acres of land. However, they cultivate 25 to 30 crops on their small and marginal lands.

This will severely stunt the wheat crop, as in last year but on a wider scale.
This means for two years, a farmer has not experienced a normal crop season; has not earned anything effectively; but has to continue doing so.
It means, after losing a Rabi crop, farmers can’t even trade with hope for the Kharif now.","A dry winter, arrival of El Nino and two years without earnings make this year terrible for Indian farmers

The more India’s farmers hope for the better, the deeper they get into distress.

In the last two years specifically, there was not a single season that was “normal” and didn’t affect farms and thus farmers. The southwest monsoon of 2021 was statistically normal, rescued from a deficit state to a near normal one by excess rainfall in September.

August 2021 was the sixth-driest month since 1901. While some farmers had normal crops, others lost them. But they were hopeful as the late withdrawal of monsoon and heavy rain in September and October meant good soil moisture and reservoir levels for a bumper harvest during the Rabi season.

In the beginning of 2022, extreme rainfall and coldwaves dashed that hope by damaging standing crops. While the world was entering into a severe food crisis as the Russia-Ukraine war started, Indian farmers had their own battles to fight.

The late withdrawal and excess rain events spurred the Rabi acreage. But the severe heatwave during harvest time in April-May 2022 led to widespread crop loss, particularly of wheat. This led to a downward revision of overall grain production.

The wait for the monsoon started and the dire situation of 2021 repeated. Another “normal” monsoon with an uneven temporal and spatial distribution — long dry spells and heavy rains towards the end of the season, or in September — led to widespread crop loss.

Excess rain in September has been an unmissable trend, at least in the last three years. The monsoon extended to the end of October, 2022; 52 per cent of the 36 meteorological subdivisions received above normal rainfall.

This brought down the paddy harvest and delayed the Rabi crop for nearly two months. The sudden rise in temperature led to the stunting of the wheat crop and the government stopped export of wheat in May, anticipating a shortfall.

So, for three consecutive crop seasons, there has been no occasion a farmer could even recover cost; accruing loss instead.

Expectedly, all hopes were mortgaged to the Rabi crop of 2023. Farmers took up Rabi crops in 15 per cent more farms than last year. This year, the blow is severe — the winter has effectively vanished by January end and the country is experiencing mid-March temperatures.

And this unusual high temperature is not just felt in the wheat-growing northern parts of India but also in the eastern part of the country. This will severely stunt the wheat crop, as in last year but on a wider scale. So, the losses are going to be more. This means for two years, a farmer has not experienced a normal crop season; has not earned anything effectively; but has to continue doing so.

Will the next Kharif crop season be normal? Weather forecast has pressed the alarm bell — the three-year La Nina is on the wane and the dreaded El Nino will make an entry in 2023 by July. El Nino usually means a subdued monsoon for India and also extreme heat.

It means, after losing a Rabi crop, farmers can’t even trade with hope for the Kharif now. As they say, hope is not a strategy or plan. But what if it is the only commodity that farmers own?

For the country’s overall foodgrain situation is also going to be hit, adding food inflation as well as making the poor more vulnerable to food insecurity. The hope of the Rabi crop harvest reaching even last year’s level is waning.

On the other hand, the government’s food stock has been depleting, first for meeting the food security scheme’s commitment and second due to releasing some three million tonnes of grain into the market to keep the inflation under control.

Without a bumper harvest in the next two months means we are hitting a scarcity situation. This will lead to higher food inflation. Notwithstanding the free foodgrains under the food security scheme, people have to fork out more for food. This adversely impacts the overall income levels, particularly for farmers who have not earned a profit for the last four consecutive seasons.

23 February 2023, India: Bayer has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with WayCool, a Food and Agritech company, as a strategic partner to deliver end-to-end holistic solutions to smallholder farmers in India.

The strategic collaboration aims to provide Indian farmers with access to premium products and solutions via a unified platform and personalized advice, to establish and implement a sustainable crop production model. Through Bayer’s Better Life Farming Centers and Farmer Producer Organisations, smallholder farmers will be able to access timely crop advisory, transfer of good agricultural practices, and WayCool’s full stack services.

Bayer and WayCool have identified three key focus areas to support the farming community in India through their strategic collaboration. The first is a phydigital platform that offers one-stop solutions, the second is the economic benefits derived from the Food Value Chain partnership, and the third is the use of Bayer’s Better Life Farming Centers and Farmer Producer Organisations. WayCool’s farmer engagement business arm, “Outgrow,” will leverage a digital application to provide farmers with solutions and services, while the on-ground network will be mobilized through WayCool’s Outgrow Network Partners across Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, as well as Bayer’s Better Life Farming Centers across the country. Further, WayCool will provide market linkages to help smallholder farmers get better prices for their produce.

Speaking on the partnership, Simon-Thorsten Wiebusch, Country Divisional Head – Crop Science Division of Bayer for India, Bangladesh & Sri Lanka, said, “Digitization of the complete value chain is a key enabler of advancing agriculture in India and a primary goal of the Crop Science Division at Bayer. To be able to offer these services to an expanded smallholder farmer base across the country and deliver greater value to them through a capable partner like WayCool will only bring us a step closer to this critical objective.”

Commenting on the MoU,Mr. Sanjay Dasari, Co-founder, WayCool,said, “As India progresses towards climate-smart agriculture, and achieving food security, the problem of rising temperatures and pest infestation is a significant challenge for farmers today in crop cultivation. This often leads to a loss in yield and productivity. Recognizing this pain point, we are extremely happy to partner with Bayer and aid the Indian farming community in this fight. Together we hope to support the creation of efficient and climate-resistant food ecosystems, in line with our vision to transform the food supply chain from farm to fork.”

The collaboration between Bayer and WayCool aims to expand their network of farmer partners and facilitate the establishment and implementation of a sustainable crop production model. By providing customized services at the Better Life Farming Centers, the partnership will bring economic benefits to all stakeholders and enable farmers to achieve optimal price realization of their output.

Washington: The United States will continue to partner with India to tackle shared challenges, build resilient supply chains, and promote a transparent and rules-based trading system for market economies and democracies, the Biden Administration said Wednesday.

The United States and India share a dynamic and important trade and investment relationship, the US Trade Representative said in its President’s 2023 Trade Policy Agenda.

In 2021, the two countries relaunched the Trade Policy Forum (TPF), which had not met since 2017, it said, adding that India and the US convened the 13th meeting of the TPF in Washington in January last year.

“Our governments discussed the tremendous potential for growth between our economies and how we can work together to bring a positive impact to working people in both countries,” it said.

“The United States will continue to partner with India to tackle shared challenges, build resilient supply chains, and promote a transparent, rules-based trading system for market economies and democracies,” the USTR said in its India section of the report.

According to the USTR, throughout 2022, the US engaged with India on an ongoing basis in response to specific concerns affecting the full range of the bilateral trade relationship.

Following the November 2021 re-launch of the TPF, the principal bilateral forum for discussing trade and investment issues affecting the two countries, 2022 was characterized by regular engagement through the TPF’s four technical-level workings groups — on agricultural goods, non-agricultural goods, services and investment, and IP, it said.

These TPF working groups, which include participation by senior-level officials from key U.S. agencies, provide an opportunity to achieve meaningful results and to address the general trend of increasingly trade-restrictive policies in India that continue to inhibit the potential of the trade relationship, the report said.

“A TPF Ministerial meeting was held on January 11, 2023. In addition to utilizing the TPF as a mechanism for resolving specific trade concerns, USTR continues to stress its interest in engaging with the Government of India on issues in the areas of labor, environment, digital trade, trade facilitation, and good regulatory practices, among others,” the USTR said.

It said the United States is leading on the world stage with a positive economic vision, and it is collaborating with partners that share their goals – growing the middle class, redressing inequality, and incentivizing climate and environmental action.

The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population, indigenous people, India’s different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition, mental wellbeing, self care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change.

With low investment in production, this superfood also proves to be a sustainable and viable income source for small farmers

By Telangana Today Published Date - 12:45 AM, Thu - 23 February 23

By Tej Singh Kardam

Hyderabad: A study by the National Academy of Sciences shows that the common millet (Panicum miliaceum) appeared as a staple crop in northern China about 10,000 years ago, suggesting that it might have been domesticated independently in this area and later spread to Russia, India, the Middle East and Europe. In India, in the Yajurveda texts, millets have been mentioned identifying as – priyangava (foxtail millet), aanava (Barnyard millet) and shyaamaka (black finger millet), thus indicating that their consumption was common pre-dating to Indian Bronze Age.

Millets also find mention in Shrimad-Bhagwat, in Krishna-Sudama meeting, where on return from Dwarka, Sudama found his home fascinating and he mentioned that earlier it was difficult for him to even afford grains like Kodo and Sanwa (Barnyard millet) but now have all kinds of delicacies.

Prioritising Millets

Millets are important crops in the semi-arid tropics of Asia and Africa, especially India, Mali, and Niger, with developing countries accounting for 97% of the production. The government of India has been prioritising millets for their potential to generate livelihood, increase farmers’ income and ensure food and nutritional security. In 2018, millets were rebranded as ‘Nutri-cereals’ and the year was declared as National Year of Millets to raise awareness about its health benefits and boost production.

The United Nations General Assembly in 2021, with the initiative by the government of India and supported by more than 70 countries, declared 2023 the International Year of Millets (IYM). The IYM 2023 aims to contribute to the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, especially SDG2 – Zero-Hunger, etc.

Decline in Production

Millets have been a part of the Indian food basket for hundreds of years, deeply ingrained in our food systems, culture and traditions. But their presence has reduced significantly over the years due to various reasons. Socioeconomic dynamics resulting from hardy nature of crop relegated them to be grains of the poor. They could grow without much inputs and even in the worst lands, as a result, they were looked down upon. In Madhya Pradesh until early 2000s, there was a slogan, ‘Kodo, Kutki hatao, Soybean lagao’. All these factors led to a decline in millets production and usage, and it became ‘Bhoole Bisre Anaaj’ (long forgotten grains).

There are two broad categories of millets: major (Bajra – pearl millet, Jowar – sorghum, Ragi/Mandua – finger millet and foxtail –kangani/kakun) and minor (Sanwa-Barnyard millet, Kodo, Cheena-Proso millet, little millet – kutki). India is the largest producer of millets in the world with an annual production of around 17.90 million tonnes in 2020-21, followed by Niger, Mali, Ethiopia and Senegal.

The major millets producing States in India are Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. These States account for the maximum millet production. Rajasthan, UP, and Haryana account for more than 81% of the total production, whereas Rajasthan accounts for half of the total millet production in India. Bajra and Jowar contribute the largest share to total millet production in India.

Mission Mode

Odisha, TN, Assam, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, Jharkhand and AP are in Millet Mission Mode. Odisha Millet Mission is the best model, setting an example at the national level. Chhattisgarh launched its millet mission in 2021 to become India’s millet hub by 2023. Telangana is also making good efforts in popularising millets in the State to eliminate hunger under the decentralised Millet Village Circular Economic Model.

Millets are resilient to climate change as they are pest-free, adapted to a wide range of temperatures and moisture regimes, and demand less inputs. There is an old Indian saying, highlighting the climate resilience of millets, ‘Sanwa Saathi Saath Din, Barkha Barse Raat Din’ — even if it rains day and night, ‘Sanwa’ (Bernyard millet) and ‘Saathi’ (a variety of rice) will grow in 60 days. These crops actually require minimum rainfall for their growth and can even sustain in drought-prone areas.

As low investment is required in the production of millets, they prove to be a sustainable and viable income source for small and marginal farmers. Millets are known to be the storehouse of nutrition as they are a good source of calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, vitamins, iron, micronutrients, and antioxidants, and provide protection against chronic diseases. The promotion of millets is now considered an effective strategy for tackling malnutrition in the country.

In India, over the years, the production of millets has increased from 14.5 mt in 2015-16 to 17.9 mt in 2020-21 (Department of Agricultural). The Centre launched POSHAN 2.0 in 2021 to tackle malnutrition and popularise the incorporation of millets in the local recipe to enhance the quality of supplementary nutrition. Millets are being incorporated into supplementary nutrition in Odisha, Telangana and Chhattisgarh among others.

Millets will help to overcome issues like water scarcity, desertification, global warming and managing carbon footprints. Millets are rich in fibre contents, and consumption of dietary fibre lowers the absorption of glucose maintaining blood glucose levels and is thus useful in non-insulin-dependent diabetes. Further fibres also bind cholesterol, thus protecting from heart disease.

There are two real problems – decline in area under millet cultivation and low productivity of millets. Over the last decade, production of Jowar has fallen and Bajra too has also stagnated. So is the case of Ragi. Increasing the production of millets and reducing the decline in the area requires multiple steps like scientific inputs, financial incentives etc. There is a need to initially target small and marginal farmers having small holdings in dry land plains and hilly areas who are among the poorest households in rural India, for the cultivation of millets. They will come forward, provided they get good returns. The central and State governments should work in tandem and make sufficient efforts to popularise millets and turn them into a revolutionary movement. As the country is entering ‘Azadi Ka Amrit Kaal’, there is a focus on Jan Bhagidari – people’s movement, to bring the spotlight on this ‘superfood’ and for bringing this ancient food to the centre stage.

There is a necessity to bring these forgotten nutri-cereals to the mainstream of production and consumption. Because local production-oriented consumption will not only have health benefits for the citizens but also help in combating and eliminating malnutrition and hunger in the country.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Millets.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-spotlight-back-on-millets

Trade sources said that while the harvesting of chana on a large scale is expected to begin by the end of this month, there are reports of early maturity of the crop because of record temperature witnessed last month.

In February, monthly average maximum temperatures across the country were the highest since 1901.

The prices are expected to rule around MSP as the government holds around 1.6 MT of chana through the farmers cooperative Nafed.

“Warm climate at the time of seeding and now high temperatures at the time of harvest may play a vital role in coming days which will ascertain yield prospects for this year’s crop,” Harsha Rai of Mayur Global Corporation, an agri-business firm, said.

Inflation in chana has been consistently in the negative zone for last many months because of bumper output and surplus stocks held with Nafed.

Inflation in chana declined by 1.81% in January, 2023.

“Nafed is consistently selling its chana stock in the open market since the last many months which has kept the prices of the pulses variety under check,” Nitin Kalantri, managing director, Kalantry Food Products, a Latur, Maharashtra-based processor, said.

Because of record chana production of 13.75 MT in the 2021-22 crop year (July-June), Nafed procured more than 2.5 MT of pulses in the 2022-23 (April-June) season under the price support scheme, aimed at providing minimum support price (MSP) to farmers.

The pulses variety has a share of close to 50% in the country’s production of 27.69 MT in the 2021-22 crop year (July-June).

At present, Nafed has 2.37 MT, which is at par with the government’s buffer stock norm.

Of this, the chana stock is more than 1.6 MT. However, in the case of other varieties of pulses, because of lower procurement, the government’s stocks are smaller — moong (0.5 MT), urad (0.07 MT) and tur (0.05 MT) at present.

HYDERABAD: At a time when climate change is impacting farming across the world, researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), have developed climate-smart agriculture (CSA) investment planning tool which helps in selecting locally-appropriate practices, technologies, climate information services, policies and finance options at the Mandal and district level across Telangana.

According to the report titled ‘Towards climate-smart agricultural policies and investments in Telangana, climate risk assessment was carried out after the State was divided into 350 grids. Indicators such as temperature changes, heat and cold wave events, rainfall variability and changes in the frequency or intensity of consecutive dry and wet days in these regions were analysed.

Speaking to TNIE, the lead author Dr Shalander Kumar, Cluster Leader – Markets, Institutions and Policies, ICRISAT, says, “Climate change has been impacting agricultural production, which has resulted in increased climate risk and loss of livelihoods for the farmers. Mainstreaming CSA and food systems practices will increase productivity and adaptation to climate risk.”

The long-term climate analysis of this study indicated a high to very high climate risk in most of the mandals in Nalgonda, Adilabad, Yadadri Bhongir and Nagarkurnool districts. The other major districts facing high climate risk were Mahbubnagar, Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Rangareddy, Nirmal and Suryapet.

Target oriented data

Crops such as cotton, pigeon pea and maize were commonly cultivated in the mandals with the highest climate risks, indicating the need to promote CSA practices that enhance the resilience of these cropping systems in the short run and to assess alternative farming systems strategies for the long run.

“CSA practices may also reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is also critically important for ensuring sustainable food production and also contribute towards more environment-friendly agri-food systems,” Dr Shalender adds.

Practices that were analysed in the study are the drip irrigation system, broad bed and furrow, ridges and furrow, farm ponds, crop residue incorporation, unpuddled mechanical rice transplanting and climate information services. However, not every technique proved to be effective across conditions and districts

“The findings revealed that drip irrigation and farm pond technologies might be highly profitable and weather-resilient but not equally effective across crops and districts. Farm pond technology was found to be most effective for the cultivation of high-value crops like mango and tomato. At the same time, drip irrigation technology proved to be more effective for cotton and groundnut cultivation under extreme weather conditions. Without such information, the investment allocation for climate-resilient technologies is less likely to reach its full potential,” he explains.

Scaling up

While rising food insecurity caused by climate change has alarmed governments, policymakers and farmers across the world, Dr Shalender believes that this investment planning tool will help the people in power make decisions on crops and prioritise investment based on quantitative analysis that reduces climate risk and benefits, farmers, economically as well.

“This science-based CSA scaling framework and policy tool could easily be replicated in the other States of India, and in other countries facing climate threats,” he adds.

Rainfed farming systems, representing 54 per cent of the net sown area in Telangana have become increasingly affected by recurring drought and high climatic variability, adversely affecting the livelihoods of millions of farm families.

About 55 per cent of the State’s population is dependent on farm activity. In 2014-15, the gross state domestic product (GSDP) in the agriculture sector declined by 10.3 per cent, attributed mainly to adverse seasonal conditions

Procedure

Climate risk assessment was carried out after the State was divided into 350 grids

Indicators such as temperature changes, heat and cold wave events, rainfall variability and changes in the frequency or intensity of consecutive dry and wet days were analysed

A high to very high climate risk was seen in most mandals of Nalgonda, Adilabad, Yadadri Bhongir and Nagarkurnool districts

HYDERABAD: At a time when climate change is impacting farming across the world, researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), have developed climate-smart agriculture (CSA) investment planning tool which helps in selecting locally-appropriate practices, technologies, climate information services, policies and finance options at the Mandal and district level across Telangana. According to the report titled ‘Towards climate-smart agricultural policies and investments in Telangana, climate risk assessment was carried out after the State was divided into 350 grids. Indicators such as temperature changes, heat and cold wave events, rainfall variability and changes in the frequency or intensity of consecutive dry and wet days in these regions were analysed. Speaking to TNIE, the lead author Dr Shalander Kumar, Cluster Leader – Markets, Institutions and Policies, ICRISAT, says, “Climate change has been impacting agricultural production, which has resulted in increased climate risk and loss of livelihoods for the farmers. Mainstreaming CSA and food systems practices will increase productivity and adaptation to climate risk.”googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); The long-term climate analysis of this study indicated a high to very high climate risk in most of the mandals in Nalgonda, Adilabad, Yadadri Bhongir and Nagarkurnool districts. The other major districts facing high climate risk were Mahbubnagar, Gadwal, Wanaparthy, Rangareddy, Nirmal and Suryapet. Target oriented data Crops such as cotton, pigeon pea and maize were commonly cultivated in the mandals with the highest climate risks, indicating the need to promote CSA practices that enhance the resilience of these cropping systems in the short run and to assess alternative farming systems strategies for the long run. “CSA practices may also reduce the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) which is also critically important for ensuring sustainable food production and also contribute towards more environment-friendly agri-food systems,” Dr Shalender adds. Practices that were analysed in the study are the drip irrigation system, broad bed and furrow, ridges and furrow, farm ponds, crop residue incorporation, unpuddled mechanical rice transplanting and climate information services. However, not every technique proved to be effective across conditions and districts “The findings revealed that drip irrigation and farm pond technologies might be highly profitable and weather-resilient but not equally effective across crops and districts. Farm pond technology was found to be most effective for the cultivation of high-value crops like mango and tomato. At the same time, drip irrigation technology proved to be more effective for cotton and groundnut cultivation under extreme weather conditions. Without such information, the investment allocation for climate-resilient technologies is less likely to reach its full potential,” he explains. Scaling up While rising food insecurity caused by climate change has alarmed governments, policymakers and farmers across the world, Dr Shalender believes that this investment planning tool will help the people in power make decisions on crops and prioritise investment based on quantitative analysis that reduces climate risk and benefits, farmers, economically as well. “This science-based CSA scaling framework and policy tool could easily be replicated in the other States of India, and in other countries facing climate threats,” he adds.

Government launches GAC Portal for Social Media Complaints On 28th February 2023, Rajeev Chandrasekhar, Union Minister of State(MoS), Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology(MeitY) launched the Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC) portal, a dispute resolution mechanism, to ensure accountability of social media platforms to their users.

The portal is launched under Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (IT Rules 2021).

The GAC platform will automatically segregate the complaints made to the Grievance Appellate Committees and escalate those that require intervention by one of the three Committees constituted by the government.

Key Highlights:

i. The Grievance Appellate Committee marks a change in India’s approach to moderating social media content.

ii. The IT Rules 2021, were amended in 2022 to require social media companies to “respect all the rights accorded to the citizens under the Constitution, including in the articles 14, 19 and 21.”

This suggests that social media platforms may now be required to permit speech that is normally legal to convey in public but is not allowed on their platforms.

iii. On 28th January 2023, the Three GAC Committees were formed to receive complaints to put the amendments into action.

Public appeals are currently being accepted on the GACs website.

iv. The IT Rules already require platforms to have a procedure in place for receiving user complaints about content and appeals against takedowns; however, companies’ decisions regarding these appeals will now ultimately be subject to the GACs’ orders.

v. The platform is operational from 1st March 2023.

Three GAC Committees:

i. 1st Committee will be led by the Ministry of Home Affairs and deal with complaints about illegal or criminal activities.

ii. 2nd Committee will be under the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting and will handle misinformation or fake content.

iii. 3rd Committee will be led by the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) and will work on copyright issues or any other unlawful activity otherwise not covered elsewhere.

Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC):

i. The Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC) is established under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 [“IT Rules”], made under the Information Technology Act, 2000.

This enables individuals who are dissatisfied with complaints to social media companies on content takedown requests to have their cases heard by 1 to 3 Government-established Committees.

ii. The digital platform Grievance Appellate Committee (GAC) is an effective tool for ensuring that platforms are accountable to their users.

iii. The GAC is working on a “Digital India Bill” to give the IT Rules and other digital lawmaking a stronger legislative foundation, though it has not published any details about this planned law.

Hyderabad: The Ukraine War, which went through its anniversary on February 24, seems to be leading to a long grinding destruction than peace for the Ukrainians, and is the saddest development. The US has managed to get Europe behind to arm Ukraine more to fight its war with Russia.

Ukraine has reportedly lost a majority of its trained army, and is short of equipment and air power. The economic cost of destruction is about $1 trillion — most of Ukraine’s industry, power plants, agricultural fields, roads, bridges and rail lines are decimated, along with urban infrastructure. More than 10 lakh resourceful Ukrainians have fled, leaving behind less resourceful. Sixty per cent of its population is living in dark and cold winter without gas and electricity. The economy has contracted by 60% in the last three years, beginning with the pandemic. The West is now arming it with an aid of about $40 billion, to ruin it further in its attempt to regain lost territories.

Russia too might have lost about five hundred thousand, the beleaguered bear can afford to throw many more. Doesn’t common sense suggest discretion about peace is the better part of valour? But, there are no signs to call for peace, though Russian President Vladimir Putin declared ending the nuclear treaty with the US. We need to find answers to this desperate protracted war. There must be deeper reasons.

Bilateral Belligerence

We have entered the era of post-globalisation under declining US hegemony. The future of capitalist development is threatened by two major factors regarding its sustainability. First, the humongous inequality under corporate capitalism in the past three decades and second, climate. Both are largely determined by the neoliberal order under global oligarchs and the US stewardship. The world received a false promise that there would be a peaceful development after the fall of the Soviet Union and the Eastern Bloc. Senior Bush, Hollande and Kohl promised Gorbachev that the West won’t gobble the former subjects of Russia and wind up NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organisation), which has no meaning in a post-socialist threat.

Though the Gold Standard system served as an international payment mechanism to connect hinterlands to global trade, it resulted in extremely vulnerable conditions for deficit countries and latecomers into imperialist capitalism

On the contrary, in the absence of countervailing power, the US-led West began destroying nations to capture their natural resources. They inducted 13 countries of the old-Soviet bloc, much to the chagrin of Russia. The ongoing war in Ukraine too is a result of the continuation of this murky aggression. Not a unilateral one, but a bilateral, clash of two powers, backed by their respective oligarchic interests — Western oligarchs on the one hand and the Russian oligarchs on the other.

Further, the Western oligarchic alliance has also started a new Cold War against China, a new potential rival in the global race. The prospects of peaceful development are damned for the moment and the fate of several countries in the periphery hangs in the air perilously; many are on the verge of collapse.

Three Economic Fallouts

However, there are three important economic fallouts, with mixed prospects for the world. First, the US is now recognised as a global rentier for lending its dollar to the world and taking its pound of flesh. Second, the sanctions posed against Russia have not only failed but are also laying new pathways for an alternative payment mechanism. And third, the oligarchic nature of the current global order underlies the chaotic nature of development.

US’ share in global production fell to 18%, but the world began using dollar for 83% of transactions

• The Rise of Dollar

The present-day dollar-dominated flexible exchange rate system had assumed ascendency in the globalisation phase after the Soviet collapse in 1989. It indeed replaced the Dollar-Gold Standard during 1950-71, which itself had replaced the century-old Gold Standard of 1847-1940. There had been a search for a stable global exchange rate regime without much success.

The Gold Standard system, which was based on fixing currency levels to gold reserves, though served as an international payment mechanism to connect hinterlands of the world to global trade, resulted in extremely vulnerable conditions for deficit countries and latecomers into imperialist capitalism. This became one of the reasons for the two world wars, and it was resolved that the US would lend its surplus dollars at fixed arbitrage to countries for settling the balance of payments, known as the Bretton Woods agreement, under the aegis of John Maynard Keynes. However, the US suspended it for not being able to see the growth of others through trade, for free, and they acquired gold, while the US savings kept dwindling.

When President Richard Nixon wanted more budget for his Vietnam War but could not raise enough loans for having to maintain a fixed dollar ratio, he raised curtains for a different game. He suspended dollar-gold conversion and made it open for sale in the floating exchange market. He declared that the dollar will now be the problem of the world, not just the US alone, and it did really become one, after three decades.

While unilateral suspension of Russian accounts from SWIFT sent chills to oligarchs and nations which use dollar as a reserve currency, it is compelling a lot of countries to look for alternatives

The riches it gained in earning the arbitrage became the source to drive the US economy. It encouraged consumption to make the American Dream work while outsourcing production to China to benefit its capitalists. Its dollars from other countries began financing its consumption and the US became a net consumer of the world’s goods and services than being a producer. Its share in global production fell to 18%, but the world is still using the dollar for 83% of transactions of goods and services, which are produced outside the US. This is simply for not having an equivalent stable and valuable alternative currency. In the process, the US became a financier, collecting interest, arbitrage and differential rent, not a supplier of technology or raw materials or final goods.

Further, the US needed the global dollar reserves to be invested in Federal treasury bills, crucial for raising its public debt, as its own domestic savings dwindled in its macroeconomic strategy of boosting consumption through its credit instruments. The ever-appreciating dollar against exporting countries kept goods available cheaply for the US public, raising their living standards despite falling real incomes. These global surpluses are being used to finance the consumption of the US, instead of financing the production of nations.

Nations needed finance to undergo conditionalities of keeping floating exchange rates, for the so-called correction of their balance of payments, without any success. Thus, the dollar-dependence pushes countries into the abyss of ever-rising external debt. The speculative capital flows are playing havoc with the currencies of the world, draining their surpluses constantly and making them unviable wastelands. Unless they find an alternative, the future of the development of nations is in peril.

The ruble trades around the same 75-per-dollar rate seen in the weeks before the war, though Russia is using capital controls to prop up the currency

• Sanctions Backfire

The sanctions imposed by the Western powers on Russia have severely backfired and are threatening to send the global economy into a deep recession. The economic sanctions are expected to impose a prohibitive cost on Russia for its adventure in Ukraine. But the decision is taken with such ignorance of ground realities, where Russia is a major source of natural resources in the world, more importantly, to Europe.

Further, Russia is suspended from the global banking system, referred to as SWIFT, freezing its assets to the tune of $290 billion. Most of these belong to Russian oligarchs. These two actions led the ruble to crumble by over 50% in two days before Putin made an astonishing move. He made payment in ruble compulsory for Europe to buy gas in the very week. To everyone’s surprise, Russia managed to recover the ruble by 80% in the international market within two days.

Russia’s economy this year is projected to outperform the UK’s, growing 0.3% while the UK faces a 0.6% contraction, according to IMF

The unilateral suspension of Russian accounts from the SWIFT system sent chills not only to the oligarchs of the world but also nations which use the dollar as a reserve currency to park in US Treasuries, compelling them to look for alternatives. Countries like Brazil, South Africa, China, India and Russia have begun talks to evolve an alternative multilateral payment mechanism away from the dollar. Even Saudi Arabia is keen to join. Thus de-dollarisation is a significant development to challenge the US hegemony in global capitalism.

• Oligarchies

Multinational capital, in its ever-increasing inequality frame, is creating multinational oligarchs. The alliances and combinations appear varied, which manifests varying geopolitics. Oligarchs close to US Republicans have greater proximity with oligarchs of Putin. Russian oligarchs are trying to usurp world oil and gas reserves, by sending its Wagner private mercenaries. American private militias are also operating with similar objectives. Indian oligarchs are working with Russian oligarchs to sell their oil. Thus, global inequality has resulted in global oligarchs and true configurations are not exactly clear. These pose the greatest dangers to democracies and the rights of workers and ordinary people.

More than 30 countries, including the US, EU nations, the UK, Canada, Australia, Japan and others — representing more than half the world’s economy — are part of the unprecedented sanctions imposed on Russia

To conclude, the Ukraine war is the first tragedy in the new decade, which is a result of a desperate attempt by the US to keep its dominance. War is no option for Ukraine, but it is caught in a log jam, and no other voice is allowed in the chaos. Russia too feels desperate to fight back for its lost glory. The sanctions imposed to destroy Russia, are, in fact, destroying the world. The resulting inflation, recession, trade deficits and devaluations are rocking economies.

The world is forced to search for alternatives to the dollar, which has become a means to squeeze the world. Ruble’s resurrection has shown the way. However, the growing oligarchic nature in the past two decades is proving a double whammy for the common man, who is hammered from all sides in all countries.

Now, you’re looking at not just the millet market but at the cookie market as well, which is massive and worth billions of dollars globally.
The second challenge is to strictly maintain the quality of the millet products.","The humble millet, which was once relegated to regional cuisines, has finally come into prominence. You might be hearing a lot more about this super food in the news than ever before.

Two years ago, the UN General Assembly at its 75th session in March 2021 declared 2023 the International Year of the Millet. At the opening ceremony on 6th Dec 2022, PM Modi said, “Millet is good for the consumer, the cultivator and the climate.”

Following that, millet was given a high priority in the Union Budget. The FM referred to millet as ‘Shree Anna’ and announced that the government will promote the Indian Institute of Millet Research-Hyderabad as a Centre of Excellence for sharing best practices, research and technologies at the international level.

“The emphasis has been there, but yes it has increased significantly of late, particularly after the UN declared 2023 as the International Year of the Millet. The Indian Government is also aggressively promoting it. That’s why I think that the focus on millet has reached a peak. I reckon that the focus on millet has been building up for a couple of years now,” says Arun Nagpal, Co-founder & Managing Director, Mrida Group.

But what is the reason behind this sudden emphasis on millet?

Millet in the limelight

Experts assert that there are several reasons behind it.

First, there are the health reasons. Today about 80 per cent Indians suffer from micronutrient deficiencies, according to the Consumer Health Division of Bayer. Rice and wheat are calorie rich, but millet can be a game changer.

It is highly nutritious, gluten-free, and has a low glycaemic index, making it the ideal food option for people with various health conditions.

According to APEDAs report, coarse cereals contain a higher amount of proteins and minerals, viz, calcium, iron etc. Therefore, increasing the awareness regarding the health benefits associated with millet consumption will boost industry growth by 2025.

Various agencies such as ICRISAT are already promoting it as a ‘Smart Food’. “This is a multilateral agency that works across several countries and has been promoting millet for the last couple of years. They have an intensive programme called ‘Smart Foods’ to promote millet, as it is good for the planet, for the farmers and for you as well,” says Nagpal.

Mascot of sustainability

At a time, when everyone is appreciating sustainability, millet can be the flag bearer for sustainability. More importantly, it can withstand climate change, points out Aneesh Jain, Founder, Gram Unnati.

“Millet is adaptable to climate change. It can withstand a wide range of temperatures and moisture conditions and requires less maintenance to develop. This hardy crop has a smaller water and carbon footprint,” he asserts.

The small-seeded grasses of millet have short growth cycles (70–100 days compared to 115–150 days for rice and wheat), lower water needs (350–500 mm vs. 600–1,250 mm), and the capacity to thrive in challenging environments like mountainous terrain and poor soils, he adds.

Millets are drought-resistant and can grow in harsh conditions, making them an excellent crop for the farmers in the arid regions.

Inexpensive crop

Another reason is that millet is relatively cheap to grow, making it a viable food source for low-income households. Its cultivators save money on inputs as the crop requires a lesser amount of water and fertilisers than the other crops. Also, millet is often grown using traditional farming practices, which are low-cost and do not require expensive machinery.

Furthermore, hardy crops do not require extensive processing before they can be consumed. That’s why promoting them makes sense, says Jain.

“Millet is a dual-purpose crop. It is grown for both food and fodder, ensuring the food and livelihood security of millions of households and contributing towards boosting the profitability of farming. It makes strong economic sense in mixed farming systems,” he points out.

To boost agro-biodiversity

By introducing Shree Anna, the government is encouraging farmers to grow millet. This will diversify their crops, which in turn can help reduce their reliance on a few staple crops and make them less vulnerable to market fluctuations. This can increase the farmers’ incomes and boost their livelihoods, while also providing a consistent source of food for communities.

“It also increases agro-biodiversity owing to the wide range of its cultivators and facilitates the opportunities for mutually beneficial intercropping with other major crops. Overall, millet is significant because of its enormous potential to support livelihoods, boost farmer income, and guarantee global food and nutritional security. Boosting millet cultivation will not only help in crop diversification but will also help in diversifying the rural markets that are primarily driven by wheat & rice,” Jain comments.

It will be profitable for MSMEs

Despite having so many beneficial properties, in India, millet is somehow (that’s another story) regarded as the poor man’s food till now. People have always considered rice and wheat as the foods of the rich. So, ironically, they have actually moved away from healthy food. However, nowadays, it is trending again as a super food. The market is also seeing as an opportunity the fact that consumers are going back to traditional healthy grains, which was not the case earlier.

APEDA recently signed a MoU with Lulu Hypermarket to capitalise on the export potential of millet to the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. The mall chain will handle the promotional activities, display the millet and other value-added products, and RTE the products in international retail chains, by sourcing them from Farmer Producer Organisations, Farmer Producer Companies, women entrepreneurs, and start-ups.

The Mrida Group, which has already been promoting millet since the last eight years to uplift the agricultural economy, sees millet as a new market opening for India. “I see a huge opportunity for the small and marginal farmers in India and for the Indian economy and the Indian government on a global platform as well,” Nagpal says.

Quinoa, which is native to the Andean region of South America, became a well-known worldwide name in a similar fashion, he adds. So far, quinoa farming has positively impacted the economies of the countries of its origin. “So that is something that we can draw a lot of positive optimism from,” he avers.

According to him, the promotion of millet is going to open new markets for us in the Eastern European countries like Poland, Hungary, Bosnia, Romania, etc. Our exports are going to skyrocket as well.

Its versatile

Millet is pretty versatile as well—it can be ground into flour for baking or can be used as animal feed.

Agripreneurs and other stakeholders are looking at it as another opportunity for experimenting and innovating.

When it comes to versatility, Nagpal tells us how Mrida experimented with making millet eatables and launched their brand Earthspired. “We started this brand with the intention of helping farmers. We worked on a variety of millet and amaranth-based products, including gluten-free, high-protein and multi-grain millet flours. Then we moved up the value chain and created a line of gluten-free millet and amaranth-based cookies, followed by millet upma, millet khichdi, and ready-to-eat snacks,” he says.

Numerous other food start-ups are leveraging millets’ benefits to create products that meet the growing demand for healthier and more environmentally friendly food options.

Nutrition Dynamic Food (NDF), for example, creates millet-based snacks like khakhra, pasta, cookies, ready-to-eat meals, and other convenient food products, making it easier for consumers to incorporate millet into their diets.

“Start-ups like us can help boost demand and innovation in the millet industry. We were one of the first start-ups in the space before the hype about millet in India began,” says Arpita Doshi, CEO & Founder of Nutrition Dynamic Food (NDF).

She feels that by promoting the benefits of millet and by creating innovative products with it, start-ups can help boost the demand for millet and create a more sustainable and healthier food ecosystem in India. “However, the new brands that are entering the millet space also need to invest in R&D to improve the taste, texture, and nutritional value of millet-based products, making them more appealing to a wider audience,” she adds.

In the coming days, the company plans to introduce new millet-based products, making millet more accessible to their consumers.

Development of the packaging and processing value chain

With so many benefits, millet has become a desirable ingredient for health-conscious consumers. “The increased demand for millet will definitely help in incentivising the development of various small-scale as well as large-scale processing and packaging industries,” says Jain of Gram Unnati.

He asserts that the packaging and processing units will need to adapt to meet the SOPs. Which may involve investments in new equipment, packaging materials, and quality control measures.

“Millet processing is done at various levels. The primary processing is mainly the post-harvest processing, sorting, grading & packaging of different types of millet. The secondary processing converts the millet into pasta, poha, noodles and vermicelli, which requires a different type of packaging and machinery. It will also attract different market players, from the smaller ones to the bigger companies,” he explains.

Then come the value added/RTE products such as namkeen, biscuits, khakhra, cookies etc. This can be done at the level of the local cottage industry as well as on a more organised commercial scale. Furthermore, local markets can be created through training and equipping farmer groups and SHGs to make and sell/supply ready-to-eat products to local schools, aanganawadi centres, rural haats, etc., he adds.

In terms of packaging, millet is typically sold in large quantities or in small packages. As the demand for millet grows, there may be a greater demand for larger packages or for more environmentally friendly packaging options, such as reusable containers or biodegradable packaging materials. To meet the increased demand, more efficient and automated packaging equipment may be required.

So now we can all see why the government along with the agriculture sector is promoting millet so much.

However, the current impetus on millet is going to change the price game.

Impact on prices

“Yes definitely, the end product price is going to rise,” says Nagpal. “With more emphasis on millet, the demand for it will rise. This will start the diversification of crops and the competition will heat up,” he adds.

Doshi of NDF also feels the same, saying, “It is possible that millet-based products could be more expensive than the raw material, as the cost of processing, packaging, marketing, and distribution can add additional costs to the product.”

Prices generally rise or fall in response to commodity prices. However, when you switch from millet as a commodity to multi grain millets, you are formulating it. It is now an intellectual capital. When developing formulations and producing different products, you take them to an entirely new level.

Take the example of the millet cookie. You take the flour, make a cookie mix out of it, and make millet-based cookies. Now, you’re looking at not just the millet market but at the cookie market as well, which is massive and worth billions of dollars globally.

In addition, the availability and demand for millet-based products could also affect their price.

“If there is a high demand for these products and a limited supply, then the price could be higher. On the other hand, if there is an abundance of millet available and a low demand for millet-based products, then the price may be lower,” Doshi weighs in.

It’s also important to note that the price of millet-based products may vary depending on the specific product and the brand. Some brands may offer more affordable options, while others may charge more for premium or specialised products.

Will there be hiccups along the way?

According to market leaders, the main goal of Shree Anna and the other millet initiatives is to boost the millet economy, improve the health conditions, and promote the growth of small and medium farmers. With this intent, a new market will undoubtedly emerge, but there will also be challenges.

Nagpal asserts that in the long run, the intent can lose focus, which will be a challenge. “My concern are the small and marginal farmers which form 80 per cent of the farming community in India. With the focus on numbers, they should not be left behind in this entire development process. This is the first challenge,” he opines.

The second challenge is to strictly maintain the quality of the millet products.

“With the growing popularity of millet, adulteration and people not adhering to norms, whether they be environmental or food safety-related, are some of the challenges that can surface,” Nagpal adds.

According to him, those are the two critical things that require some level of regulation to ensure that the benefits of millet are protected. Secondly, the unscrupulous elements in the value chain should not be allowed to benefit in any form. “The benefits should actually accrue to the consumer on one end and to the producer and value generation intermediaries on the other, ensuring that the focus remains on the small and marginal farmer,” he asserts.

To sum it up, millet farming is advantageous for India

It is the right time for the agri-sector to take the lead on an initiative like this. But to make the best of this opportunity, a few factors require strong focus. Firstly, millet should be promoted on a multilateral or global scale; for which a holistic approach is essential. Secondly, rather than seeing millet as a commodity; we should look at it as a value-added product. Thirdly, we should not lose sight of the various elements of the value chain.

“We must constantly differentiate the product by ensuring value addition in its processing, packaging, and so on,” says Nagpal.

“The continuous development of promising products will eventually result in a more sustainable profile,” adds Doshi.

All of this becomes a part of the larger initiative. It is one thing to promote the International Year of the Millet, but in order to have a strong policy framework, we must ensure that its execution happens throughout the value chain.",https://smefutures.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/02113214/Humble-millets-gain-shot-in-the-arm.jpg,[],https://smefutures.com/humble-millet-is-getting-a-shot-in-the-arm/
23,Declaring jute as an agri-product is a masterstroke,2023-02-27 23:01:39+05:30,['Bizz Buzz'],"['lakh', 'jute', 'bags', 'masterstroke', 'agriproduct', 'sacking', 'norms', 'products', 'packaging', 'declaring', 'industry', 'reservation', 'production']","Two recent developments that were almost back to back augur well for the Indian jute industry, often known as the golden fibre.
The Centre has approved reservation norms for mandatory use of jute in packaging of rice, wheat and sugar for the Jute Year 2022-23.
The government purchases jute sacking bags worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore every year for packaging of food grains.
The reservation norms would further the interest of domestic production of raw jute and jute packaging material, thereby, making India self-reliant in consonance with Aatmanirbhar Bharat.
Jute fulfils all sustainability parameters and that is great augury for Indian jute industry and all its stakeholders.","Two recent developments that were almost back to back augur well for the Indian jute industry, often known as the golden fibre. The Centre has approved reservation norms for mandatory use of jute in packaging of rice, wheat and sugar for the Jute Year 2022-23. The norms provide for full reservation for packaging of foodgrains and 20 per cent reservation for packaging of sugar in jute bags, which will be a big boost for West Bengal, in particular, where close to 75 jute mills operate and provide livelihood to lakhs of people. It will support 40 lakh farm families in the jute sector spread across Bihar, Odisha, Assam, Tripura, Meghalaya, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana.

In another significant development, albeit belated, the Centre has formally declared jute as an 'agricultural product'. A plant fibre, its industrial use and diversification of products should have been given this recognition, long back. Now, like other agricultural products, all kinds of incentives must be given to jute farmers. They and traders can now overcome the uncertainty of jute's future, and look to the future more confidently besides feeling financially secure. The latest development is also expected to streamline the jute sector from production to export.

Significantly, the jute industry occupies an important place in the national economy. Nearly 75 per cent of the total production of the jute industry is jute sacking bags of which 85 per cent is supplied to Food Corporation of India (FCI) and state procurement agencies (SPAs) and remaining is exported or sold directly. The government purchases jute sacking bags worth nearly Rs 9,000 crore every year for packaging of food grains. This ensures a guaranteed market for the produce. The average production of jute sacking bags is about 30 lakh bales (9 lakh MT) and the government is committed to ensure complete off-take of their production in order to protect the interests of jute farmers, workers and persons engaged in the industry. The reservation norms would further the interest of domestic production of raw jute and jute packaging material, thereby, making India self-reliant in consonance with Aatmanirbhar Bharat.

Talking about the other crucial decision, now that jute has been recognised as an 'agricultural product', the country's future strategy should be to exploit its competitive edge in terms of its environmental benefit.

Kochouseph Thomas Chittilappilly, the founder and chairman of V-Guard Industries, is an icon of corporate Kerala. He is someone who has rewritten the history of entrepreneurship in the state. He talks to TNIE about his struggles, life philosophies, ventures, and how Kerala’s business climate has changed over the years. Edited excerpts:

You began a startup and ran it successfully, much before the term startup became fashionable. How was the beginning?

To tell you the truth, entrepreneurship was nowhere in my wildest dreams. I always wanted to be a scientist. I had applied many times to ISRO. Fortunately or unfortunately, I never got selected. So I joined a small company, but it was struggling financially. I tried for other jobs, unsuccessfully. It was then that I decided to start something of my own. I never imagined that it would become this big. I became an entrepreneur out of compulsion (chuckles).



The life of a first-generation entrepreneur is never that easy. How was your journey?

I began my journey 46 years ago. At that time, entrepreneurship was not much appreciated. We did not have many successful examples then, and had to overcome many hurdles. I started very small. We grew up gradually, but steadily.



Have heard that you had a learning disability...

Yes, I had. I used to jumble letters and my writing speed was very low compared to others. I had difficulty completing exams on time. I was just an average student.



You had faced strikes and tussles with trade unions in the initial years. Now the Left government has become proactive and business- friendly. ‘Nokkukooli’ has been banned... How do you view this change?

We had faced many such issues initially. Strikes were very common in those days. All political parties — both Left and Congress — had a negative attitude towards business. Things have improved a lot now. Politicians have realised that entrepreneurship is important. Development will happen only if political parties take things seriously. Now one can see the change and that is a good sign.





During the early struggles, did you ever feel like leaving everything?

No. I could not afford to leave it as I did not have any other choice.

It is said you grew up taking advantage of the inefficiency of our system...

(Chuckles) That is correct. Voltage stabilisers are required because there is voltage fluctuations. You will not find stabilisers in the west as they don’t experience such power fluctuations. Then, I also realised that I need to diversify as voltage fluctuations will soon be a thing of the past. Now stabilisers account for only a small portion of our products.

Have you stopped the production of any products?

We stopped producing wall clocks and PVC pipes as they were not profitable.

You started the first amusement park in the state when most Malayalis had never heard of it...

I sat on the idea for a long time as it required quite a lot of investment. Many had warned me against investing a huge amount of money in a field where I had no expertise in. But my gut feeling was for it, and once V-Guard got stabilised I started it. It became a success soon. We started one in Bengaluru and another in Hyderabad. Now, all are running quite successfully.



You have been in this business for 46 years. Why didn’t you attempt to scale up from electrical to electronics?

V-Guard doesn’t make exclusive or patented items. We are manufacturing quality products for the common man. But we keep upgrading our products regularly and ensuring quality. I am happy producing what the market demands and that is what our growth denotes. You can say I am scared of MNCs (chuckles).

Did you have a succession plan?

For the past 10 years, I have not been involved in the activities of V-Guard. So, I have no role in the current growth. When we had an expansion plan, I decided to go for a public issue. And that was a right decision, as it has made the company more professional.



What is your employee strength now?

More than 6,000 permanent employees.

Have heard that you hired 10th failed persons initially...

That was mere common sense. I knew that well-qualified people would not join my new company (chuckles).



What is your philosophy regarding hiring?



I give more importance to one’s attitude and commitment than academic excellence. I always remember that I was an average student. If I can perform this much, then anybody can. So academic qualifications don’t matter much.



How do you assess Malayalis as employees?

Malayalis have many strengths and are a step ahead of others. That is primarily because we have been educated for generations. Some say Malayalis don’t stick to a job for long. But I would say that is because they deserve more money.



Do you think Malayalis lack entrepreneurial skills or business acumen?

I don’t think so. Many Malayalis have performed well in other countries. Social climate was not encouraging towards entrepreneurship earlier.

V-Guard is branching out more in North India these days. Why?

We entered North India only after the second generation took over. Now there is a huge demand from the markets there.



Do you think Kerala is becoming more business-friendly?

Certainly. Things have improved drastically in Kerala.



In what ways?

Earlier, if you approached a minister with a problem, he or she wouldn’t even understand it. They used to view investors as bourgeois and class enemies. Those who make money were looked down upon as criminals. Though some apprehensions still exist, the mood is much more welcoming now.



Kitex MD Sabu M Jacob had to shift his business to Telangana. Wasn’t it very damaging to Kerala’s image?

His decision to shift operations has made the government more alert. It has turned more cautious, to avoid similar incidents. So in a way, his move has helped improve the overall climate.



Are you still part of Twenty20?

Not, any more.



Why did you decide to join it?

I thought it was a good concept. Sabu proved that if there is a vision, one can improve a panchayat. But I realised later that the process is not as easy as was expected.



Some of your social media posts had courted controversy... One also gets a feeling that your politics is anti-Left...

I normally share newspaper cuttings on issues I feel connected to. I am not against BJP or CPM or Congress. When I have some difference of opinion I express them. I am neutral, I have no political leanings.

Do you agree with the idea of businessmen joining politics?

It is difficult to handle business and politics together. I think one can be passionate about only one thing at a time. Otherwise, both will suffer.



How do you assess the Pinarayi Vijayan-led government ?

This government is trying hard to make things better. We have reached the brink. Our GST collection will increase only if there is production within the state. So it’s important to focus on more manufacturing units. How long can we go on depending on loans?



Have they ever taken your suggestions or advice?

P Rajeeve calls me occasionally and we exchange ideas. He and his team are trying hard to make changes. But the problem is that they are reaping what they sowed earlier.



You got some bad press recently over an accident that happened in the amusement park. The allegation was that you offered Rs 5 lakh to a woman who questioned a road blockade but that you refused to give proper compensation to someone who met with an accident in your park...

He was drunk and that was how the accident happened. We had all the proof. But still, we helped him initially. Later, with the support of a political party, he started to cause damage to our reputation. Then we also decided to take the legal route. Now, the matter is settled.



Do you think the Indian rich are yet to wake up to philanthropy?

There was such a time. But Tata Group, Azim Premji and Infosys are all very much into philanthropy these days.



You donated a kidney at a time when organ transplantation was not much heard of...

I started thinking about it when I saw one of my distant relatives struggling to find a donor. She died without one. When I heard about the struggle of another man, I decided to donate. The only condition I set was that his wife should donate a kidney to someone else. She did it and it went on like a chain. I was 60 when I donated a kidney and I am still healthy 12 years after the surgery.



You had earlier approached the court for euthanasia...

I believe we must have the right to decide how our last days are. I have already written a will on how it should be and have got it registered. I have said that I don’t need a ventilator or other life-saving support systems. One should have the right to decide that, I believe.



What does ‘V’ in V-Guard stands for?

(Chuckles) Actually, there is no particular meaning. When I started, I did not have money for any advertising activities. So I myself named it ‘V-Guard’ with the simple logic that it is something that protects. People now say ‘V’ in V-Guard stands for victory. Let it be so...



Kerala is going through a financial crisis…

Yes. The state is in a very bad financial condition because successive governments have been pampering their employees. Also, the government has taken up all the responsibilities, including salaries, for teachers in aided colleges. There is too much spending in the social sector while there is not enough money for developmental initiatives.



Are Malayalis spending? Is money coming to the market?

Yes, Malayalis have money individually. Their spending power is very much intact. The state economy is very much vibrant if you look at the market for consumer products or cars. Gulf money also plays a major role in keeping Kerala’s economy robust.



Do you think we lag behind other states because Malayalis are still in the clutches of ideology?

That is because of two reasons. One is historical. We had a blessed geography while most other states like Gujarat or Rajasthan were reeling under drought. So while they were forced to turn to trade, we were happy doing agriculture. Another reason is that we used to believe that socialism and communism were the best. As communism is against capitalism, that thought process affected our entrepreneurial culture.



What advice would you give to somebody who wants to invest in Kerala?

This market offers a great opportunity, provided their idea or product is innovative. There are multiple challenges but there are many who have made it big here.



You have very often opposed trade unions. Do you think trade unions have no social relevance?

Trade unions do have their relevance. But at the same time, they have to be aware of their responsibilities, too.



Are there trade unions in your companies?

No. There were trade unions initially. There is relevance for trade unions only if an employee has to bargain to get his rights. There is no such scenario in our companies as we insist on keeping employees happy.

What is your take on the SilverLine project?

I have been opposing it from day one because it is unviable. The state government is not capable enough to implement it. It was supposed to end this way. It is the responsibility of the central government to implement high-speed rail projects in the state.



It is difficult to get cheap labour in Kerala. But, don’t you think it is a sign of a more egalitarian society?

Kerala is way ahead of other states when it comes to socio-economic indicators. We are better educated, we have better standards of living and high aspirations. There is no poverty... If other states emulate Kerala, the whole country will become developed.



There are stories about you carrying V-Guard products in your scooter for sale. You have come a long way. When you look back, what is one thing that has helped you the most to achieve all these? Is it luck or is it hard work or a combination of factors?

I don’t believe in luck. If there is luck, then there should be bad luck, too. So it gets nullified that way. What is most important is willpower and determination to face hardships. One should not crumble during a crisis situation.



You do business in many states. Compared to others, where does Kerala stand in terms of levels of corruption?

I would say Kerala is one of the the least corrupt states in the country.

What is the one thing that you don’t like about your character?

I have this temptation to react to injustice. I have suffered because of that. But I have no regrets.



Do you advise your kids?

I don’t believe in giving advice to anyone. All that one can do is set examples with our lives. I am someone who has not listened to anybody’s advice. I may listen to suggestions, but the decision will always be mine. That being the case, I don’t think advice is of any use to anyone (chuckles).

Telangana government and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) announced Data in Climate Resilient Agriculture (DiCRA) as the latest addition to the Digital Public Goods Registry, a move aimed at equipping farmers with information on impact of climate change.

Using remote sensing and pattern detection algorithms, DiCRA is able to identify farms resilient to climate change and those highly vulnerable. It harnesses open-source technologies to facilitate analysis and insights sharing on climate resilience, based on empirical inputs crowdsourced from hundreds of data scientists and citizen scientists on best performing farms. The platform, powered by Artificial Intelligence (AI), is geared towards strengthening food systems and food security, Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao’s office said in a release.

The DiCRA platform will put vital data and analytics in the hands of farmers, enabling them to mitigate the effects of climate change on their crops and livestock thus boosting resilience of their livelihoods and wider food security, UNDP Administrator Achim Steiner said.

“With UNDP Accelerator Labs and partner organisations, we are proud to facilitate this first-of-its-kind digital commons to drive climate action not only for Telangana but for the entire world,” the Minister said.

Describing DiCRA becoming a part of Digital Public Goods Registry as an important milestone in Telangana’s commitment to open data policy, service delivery to farmers and anticipatory governance to combat the global challenge of food security, he said in partnership with the vibrant innovation ecosystem in the State it provides intelligence on climate resilience at the farm-level.

Within a period of three months, DiCRA gained more than 500 citizens and scientists from local digital ecosystems to support climate action in 112,077 square km of land in the State. DiCRA provides open access to both data as well as analytics derived through open software, allowing it to be replicated across the world.

The impact of climate change on agriculture is multifold, affecting crop yield, nutritional quality and livestock productivity. UNDP Resident Representative in India Shoko Noda said “digital technologies hold immense potential in building resilience as we fight climate change. With DiCRA, we are happy to combine new-age data-driven technology for informed decision making to boost agricultural productivity. We look forward to scaling the use of the platform across India.”",https://www.thehindu.com/theme/images/og-image.png,[],https://www.thehindu.com/news/cities/Hyderabad/farmers-to-get-ai-inputs-on-climate-change/article65641053.ece

Contemplating taking his life, he called the Kisan Mitra helpline as a last resort.
The Kisan Mitra team, with the help of funds sanctioned by the collector, also helps the farmers with alternative livelihood means.
The majority of the calls were about issues related to DBT schemes, land, crop loss, crop insurance and farmer suicides.
The Kisan Mitra team received 298 grievances that could have been addressed to Spandana in Anantapur and Satya Sai districts.","Adilabad: One hot summer morning in Telangana’s Adilabad district, Muthi Shivanna, 38, sat in the centre of his cotton field in a village called Landasangvi.

In his hand was a bottle of pesticide.

A farmer for 20 years, Shivanna eventually called a helpline he had found through awareness programmes run by a nonprofit and told them he had been thinking about his crop losses and his debts.

He said he called the helpline when he found himself on the verge of taking what he described as “an extreme step”.

As a field coordinator from the team running the Kisan Mitra (literally translated as friend of the farmer) helpline in Adilabad rushed to his farm, a counsellor kept Shivanna on the phone for a tense hour.

The team saved Shivanna, who had been in distress because of a confluence of factors that often hit farmers. In Shivanna’s case, these were a Rs 900,000-loan, the damage to his cotton crop by a flood during the monsoon of 2022, and the money he had not received for land he had sold.

The southern state of Telangana, with the fourth-highest number of farmer suicides in India as per the Accidental Deaths and Suicides in India (ADSI) 2019 report of the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), witnessed a spurt in farm suicides between 2017 and 2019, coinciding with extensive loss of crops due to drought-like conditions and heat waves.

The then collector of Vikarabad district, Divya Devarajan, started the Kisan Mitra helpline in collaboration with the Center for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA) and farmers’ rights organisation Rythu Swarajya Vedika on Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar’s birthday in 2017 to respond to farmers in distress.

Kisan Mitra not only became Telangana’s first helpline for farmers struggling with thoughts of self-harm, but also went the extra mile to reach out to callers in person, to help them with alternative income-generation means.

With help from the Kisan Mitra team, Shivanna received the payment he was due and a loan from a state corporation for the welfare of backward classes.

“From the moment we are informed about a call till the time we reach the farmer it’s a tense and anxiety-filled period,” said J Narsimhulu, the field agent for Vikarabad. “We worry a lot whether we can reach on time.”

Devarajan, posted currently as commissioner for women and child development, said farmers are often apprehensive about discussing their problems in a formal setting.

“The Kisan Mitra helpline is like a bridge between the farmers and the government,” Devarajan told Article 14, “where farmers can call from the comfort of their homes and tell us their problems.”

For Distressed Farmers: Trained Counsellors, Field Agents

Since its inception, the helpline’s centres have fielded 14,381 calls from farmers, of which 10,984 calls were marked as resolved complaints and closed. Complaints from 3,397 calls are in different phases of resolution.

In Telangana, the maximum number of calls received were from Adilabad district and in Andhra Pradesh the maximum number of calls were from Sri Satya Sai district, both regions witnessing crop damage related to climate change.

Now run by the Rural Development Service Society, a nonprofit, in collaboration with field organisations and state-level networks, the helpline is supported by AID (Association for India’s Development), a non-profit that supports families of farmers affected by suicides and natural disasters, and i4Farmers, a US-based non-profit.

The helpline operates in the two Telugu-speaking states of Telangana (Vikarabad, Adilabad, Mancherial, Nalgonda and Yadadri Bhuvanagiri districts) and Andhra Pradesh (Kadapa, Visakhapatnam, Satya Sai and Anantapur districts).

At each centre, trained counsellors talk to farmers calling the helpline while field outreach and research and advocacy teams address problems until a solution is found.

The field agents and Kisan Mitra team ensure to create awareness about government schemes, crop loans and subsidies to farmers and act as a bridge between the farmer and government stakeholders to offer a solution to the problems faced by farmers.

Thandra Mallappa, a farmer from Bandamidhipalli in Vikarabad, was struggling to get a land records passbook updated to show the transfer of ownership of his 1.8 acres of land to his name following the demise of his father.

Mallappa was frustrated and tired with mounting debts while his elder daughter suffered health complications from having a single kidney. His younger daughter is disabled. Contemplating taking his life, he called the Kisan Mitra helpline as a last resort.

The Vikarabad field agent immediately visited Mallappa and, after some counselling, was able to stop the 48-year-old sugarcane farmer from taking the extreme step. “I felt helpless with mounting debts and concern for my daughter’s health,” Mallappa told Article 14.

Kisan Mitra helped him get the passbook transferred to his name, and additionally helped him secure a loan using which he procured cows.

The Kisan Mitra team said they similarly helped many callers avail crop loans.

Until this help arrived, Mallappa felt there was no end to his woes. “I saw my whole life in a flash that day in 2017,” he said.

Climate Crisis Makes Farmers More Vulnerable

Scientists predict that a countrywide average temperature rise of 2.5 to 4.9 deg C could result in a decline in wheat yields by 41%-52% and in rice yields by 32%-40%. Global maize yields are also expected to decrease by 24% by 2030, due to climate change, an overall 30% decrease in crop yield is predicted in India, which will impact the lives of over 50 million farmers in India.

The National Innovations on Climate Resilient Agricultural (NICRA) was established by the union agriculture ministry in 2011 with the goal of understanding how climate change is affecting Indian agriculture and to develop measures for mitigation.

The monsoon in India has recently become erratic, with increasing precipitation unpredictability as well as extended dry periods followed by intense downpours. These impacts of climate change are expected to affect Indian agriculture and food production, and consequently more pressure on farm incomes.

There are worries about decreased outputs of summer-sown crops including cotton, corn and rice. Crop failures and pest infestation are both on the rise.

Doma Venkataiah, a farmer from the Doma cluster of villages in Vikarabad district, suffered crop damage for three straight years. “Heavy rains for three consecutive years made us suffer huge losses,” he said. They lost their entire crop during these years. “We even lost two oxen due to lightning strikes.”

According to a 2021 Telangana high court order, farmers were to be compensated by the state for loss of crop due to natural disasters.

“Every year lakhs of farmers are facing crop loss due to climate change and natural disasters, but they are not getting any compensation despite high court orders,” said Kiran Kumar Vissa, a social activist and the coordinator of Rythu Sawarajya Vedika. “As there is no crop insurance scheme, farmers are going into deep debt and are facing distress.”

The Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana, a national crop-insurance programme, has not been implemented in Telangana since 2019.

The Kisan Mitra teams organise awareness programmes on farm distress-related suicides and prevention of these suicides. They also distribute flyers about the work they do.

According to them, there is a delicate period of five to 10 minutes when a farmer contemplates taking his life.

“That is the time when a person needs moral support, a helping hand and the reassurance that everything will be alright, and the helpline is that helping hand,” said Sreeharsha Thanneru, the main coordinator of Kisan Mitra for all the districts.

‘Some Families Are Left With Nothing’

[[https://article-14.com/uploads/2022/12-December/14-Wed/Padmamma-piccredit-kavithayarlagadda.jpg]]

One early morning in 2017, Mudiraj Padmamma’s husband went to the fields to water his land and failed to return.

He had been accidentally electrocuted. Padmamma, a farmer from Narsapur village in Vikarabad, has been fighting a lone battle since then to earn and support her five daughters.

The Kisan Mitra team organised training for her in sewing and donated a sewing machine to supplement her income from the 1.5 acres of land she farms. Three of her daughters are now married.

“For any problem I face, I immediately call the helpline, and they guide me about what to do or arrange a meeting with higher officials,” said Padmamma, sitting in her single room, colourful and modest home.

Telangana implemented its first ever direct benefit scheme for farmers in 2018, called the Rythu Bandhu scheme, which helped farmers and saw a decline in farmer suicides. This scheme only benefited land owners, however, excluding tenant farmers who comprise 75% of the farmers who committed suicide in the state.

According to the Telangana Land Licensed Cultivators Act, 2011, every tenant farmer must be given an ID card and is eligible for crop loans and compensation for crop losses, a provision that is widely ignored.

Kisan Mitra took up the issue with the district administration and was able to disburse 6,000 loan eligibility cards apart from arranging loans for 1,000 farmers.

Kota Neelima, PhD, an agricultural activist, said proper data on farmers and tenant farmers is critical.

“When a tenant farmer kills himself due to distress, the land is not in his name, and his death is not even considered a farmer suicide,” said Neelima. “This leaves his struggling family left with nothing.”

[[https://article-14.com/uploads/2022/12-December/14-Wed/Santosh%20Akula.jpg]]

Troubled with increasing debts and crop loss, Santosh Akula, from Marlapally village, Adilabad district, tried to end his life by consuming poison in 2018, but was saved after receiving treatment at the right time.

Akula had two daughters and three sisters and a loan of Rs 380,000. The two plots of land he cultivated were not in his name, while a small dairy he ran suffered losses.

The Kisan Mitra team arranged a meeting for him with the collector and helped get the land registered to his name. “It was confusing and depressing for me, all I thought was that suicide would end all my problems,” said Santosh.

Distress Among Farmers: Floods, Debt, Birth Of A Girl

The team of Kisan Mitra organises meetings of all families within a district who were affected by farmer suicides, to assess the reasons and circumstances.

Tribal farmers were increasingly committing suicides in Adilabad, they found. The main trigger for considering suicide was loss of crop due to floods, debt, the birth of a girl child and inability to provide healthcare for family members. These surveys helped the team address the cause of distress, particularly through assistance in identifying alternative means of livelihood.

Vadde Ramulamma from Yenkepalle village in Vikarabad district called the helpline seeking help with the Rythu Bandhu payout (an incentive of Rs 5,000 per acre from the state government to support two crops in a year). Money due to her had been incorrectly transferred to another person’s account. The field coordinator intervened and coordinated with the bank, resulting in a sum of Rs 95,000 being transferred to Ramulamma’s account.

Similarly, the helpline receives calls from farmers for issues related to documentation, passbook-related queries, etc.

The Kisan Mitra team, with the help of funds sanctioned by the collector, also helps the farmers with alternative livelihood means. The team has helped families with getting ex gratia sums, widow pension, education of children and exemption of school fees in some cases.

The majority of the calls were about issues related to DBT schemes, land, crop loss, crop insurance and farmer suicides.

Apart from the Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bhima schemes, the Telangana government also provides an interest-free crop loan to all farmers up to Rs 1 lakh, and Pavala Vaddi (a scheme with an interest rate of 25 paise) for crop loans from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 3 lakh, the Dalit Bandhu scheme, assistance with inputs and crop planning, etc.

According to Shrinivas Badiger, fellow at the Center for Environment & Development, ATREE, in India, input-intensive farming is a major contributor to climate change, while dryland agriculture is also victim to monsoon uncertainties arising out of climate change. “If we don't take action to reduce the impacts of climate change on agriculture, millions of small and marginal farmers in India who cultivate mostly rain-fed crops will face loss of livelihood due to increasing droughts and floods,” Badiger said.

During the monsoon of 2022, Adilabad district was the worst affected with an estimated 1.03 lakh acres of crop destroyed.

Enforcing Accountability Of Government Officials

Spandana, a public grievances redressal portal, is an initiative of the government of Andhra Pradesh. All grievances received through this portal are supposed to be resolved in a time-bound manner.

The Kisan Mitra team received 298 grievances that could have been addressed to Spandana in Anantapur and Satya Sai districts. As the government is not accountable for calls received on the helpline, Kisan Mitra registers all these grievances on the Spandana online system or by attending the weekly programs.

Kisan Mitra is now trying to understand the gaps in the ability of farmers to use the online grievances system and other government schemes.

The helpline plays an active role in creating awareness about different government programmes to ensure that farmers receive the benefits on time.

The state received heavy rainfall of more than 60 per cent in many places in this year’s monsoon season.

The weather systems formed over the Bay of Bengal usually travelled in the north-westerly direction towards Odisha, Jharkhand and upto the North-East regions. Over the past five years, this trend was changing as low pressure areas are taking more of a westerly route and are more intense, leading to heavy downpour.

Vice president of Meteorology and Climate Change, Skymet Weather, Mahesh Palawat, told Deccan Chronicle, “Around 12 low pressure areas were developed this year over Bay of Bengal. Almost 9 of them moved in the Westerly direction and the latest 2-3 weather systems mostly travelled in the north-west direction. Because most of the low pressure areas moved in westerly direction, they had an impact over north coastal Andhra Pradesh, parts of Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Maharashtra and Telangana. Such changing weather systems have been a result of extreme climate change effects.” As all the low pressure areas travelled within the vicinity of the north Telangana, including 1-2 weather systems in the central parts of Telangana, these resulted in intense weather activities such as heavy downpour, especially over northern Telangana such as Adilabad, Komaram Bheem, Jayashankar, Jagtial and Kamareddy.

Another aspect was the increase in the cyclonic activity in the Arabian Sea because of the rising sea surface temperatures due to global warming. “Earlier, the number of cyclones developed in the Arabian Sea was lesser than Bay of Bengal with a ratio of 3:7, but now is almost at par for the past 4-5 years as the Arabian Sea is also heating up. Moreover, the intensity and frequency of weather systems (low pressure area) are more because the sea surface temperatures are warmer as a result of global warming and climate change.

In effect, extreme weather events are occurring, wherein the number of rainy days have shrunk with the intense rainfall over short periods, causing local flooding,” Palawat stated. As per the experts’ observations, such contrasting weather events will be more frequent and the geographical distribution of rainfall across the country will be contrasting. Research director and adjunct associate professor of Bharti Institute of Public Policy, ISB and author of IPCC, Anjal Prakash said, “Because of climate change, the monsoon patterns -- and due to their effect the rainfall patterns -- will change drastically in Telangana. Heat waves will be starker and monsoons will be wetter in the state in the years to come.”

Agriculture will be the first sector that will be impacted because of the changing monsoon patterns. Uneven and unpredictable distribution of rain will affect the farming operations, more so for the Kharif crop production of rice, which forms 50 per cent of the nation’s food production. “A large population in Telangana is still dependent on agriculture. Rice is the staple food of the people and the major production system. There will be a long-term impact on the food production because of the uneven rain distribution, more so on the paddy production. So we need to produce drought-resistant varieties of rice and incorporate the older systems of rice production which are more sustainable, considering the uncertain monsoon systems,” Prakash said. The way forward in combating climate change in the state, he added, would be conservation of city lakes, increasing the blue and green infrastructures and climate-proof policies.",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-pbo047f4ql7d8un4n538sjvmh0-20200611112918.Medi.jpeg,[],https://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/in-other-news/220922/climate-change-alters-monsoon-system-in-telangana.html

In July 2022, India, Israel, the United States (US), and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in a hybrid summit announced the establishment of a new minilateral grouping called the I2U2. The four countries envision their alliance as an ad-hoc, informal, issue-specific and geoeconomic initiative.[1]

The I2U2 is only one of a number of minilateral forums that have been created in the past several years. Unburdened by the complexities of decision-making and institutional constraints of larger organisations, “minilaterals (which often involve three to nine countries) offer an edge vis-à-vis flexibility, informality, select membership, and a goal-oriented focus.”[2] This shift towards multi-alignment is driven by the growing importance of geoeconomics, which is shaping the way countries collaborate and form partnerships to advance their economic interests. By focusing on shared economic interests, member countries are able to build trust, overcome political differences, and develop an expansive agenda for cooperation that integrates geopolitics and geoeconomics. Acknowledging the practicality of this paradigm shift, the joint statement of the I2U2 countries, released following the July summit, said the “grouping is intended to mobilise private sector capital and expertise to modernise infrastructure, advance low carbon development pathways for industries, improve public health and access to vaccines, advance physical connectivity, create new solutions for waste treatment, explore joint financing opportunities, and lastly, promote the development of critical emerging and green technologies, while focussing on food and energy security.”[3]

To be sure, all four countries have their own motivations for joining the grouping. For India, the I2U2 provides a forum to bolster its renewed strategic engagement with West Asia. India also has a robust bilateral relationship with each of the three countries and thus there is a strong economic rationale for its participation in I2U2. India’s total trade with UAE amounted to US$ 73 billion in 2022, making UAE India’s third largest trading partner.[4] UAE is also India’s second largest export destination and accounts for 40 percent of India’s total trade with the Arab world. Israel, meanwhile, is one of India’s top suppliers of defence equipment and a key technology partner in different domains including defence, space, agriculture, and cybersecurity.[5] For its part, the US is India’s largest trading partner and second-largest foreign investor, with bilateral trade reaching US$ 119 billion in 2022 and investments accounting for 18 percent of total Foreign Direct Investment.[6]

From Israel’s perspective, I2U2 is a continuation of the Abraham Accords and presents a new opportunity to build a platform where it can combine its old partners (the US and India) with the new (UAE) through a wider economic and strategic partnership. The Accords formalised ties between Israel and the UAE,[7] while also enabling Israel to extend its outreach into the Arab world and beyond. This aligns with Israel’s larger goal of encouraging more countries in the region to normalise relations with it.

The Emiratis view I2U2 as a coalition that is agile and purposeful. They are of the view that such a grouping, with a focus on complementarities, will help solve global challenges such as those related to security in food, energy, and water. The UAE knows these challenges only too well, given its own food and water shortages, with an annual rainfall of only 100mm and importing 85 percent of its food supplies.[8] UAE also sees I2U2 as a platform that can serve its interests in strengthening bilateral ties with the other three nations, while placing itself as the bridge between West Asia and South Asia.

For the United States, the grouping is a low-hanging fruit, following the Abraham Accords, through which it can nurture relationships with its allies and partners bilaterally as well as multilaterally, especially in the West Asian region. This also helps the US in checking the expanding Chinese footprint in the region, particularly in the fields of investment, innovation, and technology. US participation also indicates that it has shed its traditional strategic and security lens and now views the world order in a trans-regional and multilateral way.

Setting the Context

I2U2’s seeds were sown in October 2021, when the foreign ministers of the four countries held a virtual meeting to address issues concerning maritime security, infrastructure, and transport.[9] Its launch in July reflects some of the broader changes that have recently taken place in global geopolitics, especially in West Asia.

The first crucial development was the establishment of Israel’s diplomatic ties with UAE and Bahrain in August 2020 through the signing of the Abraham Accords orchestrated by the Trump administration. Relations with UAE have grown since then, at a pace that has surprised observers. Their bilateral trade (excluding software) reached US$ 2.5 billion in 2022.[10] As the Accords opened room for increased interactions between Israel and its Gulf neighbours, it has become less difficult for other partners like the US and India to engage with the region through plurilateral forums.[11]

The outbreak of the Russia-Ukraine war in early 2022, along with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, are pointing to a new era where realist considerations of shared threats push geographically divergent countries to come together and find solutions to pressing global challenges. Among the most crucial are global economic deceleration, increasing debt, supply chain break-downs, trade wars, energy insecurity, food crises, widening inequalities, large-scale poverty, and worsening climate change.[12]

The 2022 World Development Report, Finance for an Equitable Recovery has highlighted how the growing disparities between and within nations, along with slower than expected post-pandemic global recovery has “made the economic and social costs of dwindling growth more visible.”[13] This strengthens the rationale for the I2U2 to gather and manage the current multiple crises facing the region and beyond.

The I2U2 countries intend to give primacy to their economic strengths over their differing political and security concerns, and utilise the available opportunities for mutually beneficial cooperation. They will leverage “India with its growing economy, and massive human resource and talent, Israel with its niche technical know-how in a number of important fields, UAE with its vast capital and advancing innovative policies, and USA’s extensive international clout and capabilities in every conceivable area.”[14]

Since the establishment of I2U2, several meetings have taken place between officials and private sector representatives from the four countries. One of the areas that have been explored in the discussions is shoring up business-to-business (B2B) relations. During the February 2023 meeting of the four sherpas, an I2U2 Business Forum was established to accelerate joint business ventures in core economic and technological sectors.[15] There is also a proposal among private sector entities to form an enterprise called the ‘I2U2 Hub’ in UAE, which will serve as an ideation centre. It aims to utilise the network of its business members in forging economic partnerships with companies and institutions involved in research in any of the six identified sectors, with an incentive of sharing profits of intellectual property amongst the partnering institutions.

Key Projects

Distinguishing it from other regional forums like the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), Negev Forum, and AUKUS, I2U2 initially aims to focus on an economic agenda. It has identified six sectors for intervention—i.e., water, energy, transportation, space, health, and food security. The grouping envisions an active role for private capital and technology, declaring a strong commitment “to collaborate on propelling joint investments, resource mobilisation and new initiatives for seeking optimal mitigation strategy.”[16] Underscoring the practical nature of the discussions and initiatives undertaken, Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his remarks at the summit said the I2U2 “has set a positive agenda and its framework is a good model for practical cooperation in the face of increasing global uncertainties.”[17]

Two key global concerns are being prioritised by the grouping—food security and clean energy—which have local, trans-regional and long-term dimensions.

Food corridor project

Some 820 million people across the globe are suffering from hunger[18] and many regions are facing a looming food crisis. The I2U2’s food security project aims to address food insecurity by capitalising on the member countries’ comparative advantages across financial, technological, agricultural and knowledge domains.

The project will use Israeli and American technology to establish integrated food parks in the states of Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, with future expansion planned for other states, including Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. The project is being financed by the Abu Dhabi Development Holding Company (ADQ)— an active sovereign wealth fund that has committed an overall investment worth US$2 billion.[19] The broader objective of the initiative is to create alternate supply chains among countries with similar goals, to guarantee food security that is environmentally sustainable.

The project will be driven through a comprehensive public-private partnership model, involving the concerned state governments, the central government, and the private sector spearheaded by the Confederation of Indian Industry (CII). Some of the private firms that have been selected for developing the value chains include ITC, Innoterra and Olam. DP World has been designated as the logistics partner for operationalising the food corridor through development of eco-friendly integrated logistics services like container terminals at seaports, private rail rakes, regional procurement centres, and warehousing and refrigeration facilities.

Analysts note that the project will not only help the Gulf countries achieve food security, but also “enable India to increase the value of its food production by taking advantage of advanced investments and technology that will enter its agriculture sector.”[20] This, in turn, will help enhance Indian farmers’ incomes and support job creation through development of post-harvest activities. Being a food-surplus nation and a large producer of wheat, dairy, vegetables and fruits, India has a lot to offer, and gain from this project. Highlighting its significance, Indian Foreign Secretary Vinay Mohan Kwatra explained that “the proposed food parks have a set of objectives that include how to reduce trade barriers between I2U2 economies, how to harmonise food quality and safety standards, and how to use this opportunity to benchmark India as a top exporter of perishables through access to strategic markets of the Gulf and European region.”[21]

Hybrid renewable energy project

To reduce the use of fossil fuels and increase the share of renewables in energy production as agreed at COP27,[22] the second I2U2 project will establish a 300-megawatt hybrid renewable energy facility (wind and solar) in Gujarat. The facility will be complemented by an advanced battery storage technology that will be developed with the help of Israeli expertise, and Emirati and American investments. It aims to bring down battery storage costs and make renewable energy an attractive option for the industrial sector. The project is currently valued at US$330 million, and the financing will be done through public-private partnership.

UAE-based companies like Masdar have shown strong interest in “exploring opportunities to serve as critical knowledge and investment partners in the renewable energy space,”[23] particularly in the context of UAE’s position as host of COP28 scheduled in December 2023. For India, its reliance on coal—which generates 70 percent of its electricity—and the limitations in importing Liquefied Natural Gas, has motivated the country to diversify its energy mix. This has incentivised Indian companies to participate in renewable energy projects to contribute to the country’s goal of achieving 500 gigawatts of non-fossil fuel capacity by 2030.[24] A feasibility study on the project, funded by the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA), has already given a green light to the project.

Potential Challenges

The first potential challenge for the I2U2 is that individual countries may give primacy to their own security interests, which may be in contrast to those of another. For example, “Iranian rivalry is central to the US and Israeli outlook of West Asia,”[25] while India and UAE might have a different perspective. Although the four countries have so far been able to keep these security considerations at bay, the situation with regard to Iran remains unpredictable.

Meanwhile, the US and India are wary of China’s footprint in the region, which the latter is expanding through trade deals, infrastructure investments and security cooperation. Israel and UAE, for their part, have a more positive view of China, with UAE upgrading its ties to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership[26] and Israel engaging China in defence and technical cooperation.[27]

A second set of concerns are related to institutional bottlenecks. There could be lack of synergy in the working cultures of business people from the four countries, and accountability mechanisms may be vague. The sherpas of the respective countries should acknowledge these potential roadblocks and streamline processes to enforce checks and balances.

India’s Stakes

India’s position as the glue that binds West Asia with South Asia makes its active participation in the grouping of utmost importance. At the same time, India can leverage investments, innovation and technology from I2U2 to accelerate its own journey towards becoming the world’s third largest economy in the coming decade. I2U2 can also be a force-multiplier for the ‘Make in India’ initiative by pushing for manufacturing facilities to be set up in the country, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence, fintech, transportation, and space.

To ensure fruitful cooperation with the other three countries, India could take a cue from the US and designate I2U2 nodal officers in each of its embassies in the three countries. The sherpa, along with these nodal officers, can form a Coordinating Committee that will help streamline official communication and monitor progress. The I2U2 grouping could potentially become a catalyst for India to spearhead similar minilateral groupings with its other partners in South Asia and Africa.

Conclusion

The four member nations of I2U2 should create a consolidated roadmap to bring their plans to fruition. There is a need to institutionalise a system of regular meetings between the foreign ministers and an annual summit of the leaders to keep the grouping active and ensure timely implementation of decisions. The member countries can devise an institutional framework with dedicated resources, professionals, and clear goals. For this, like the G20, it can establish joint Task Forces on specific sectors with participation from government, academia, think tanks, and the private sector. These task forces can act as both, ‘idea banks’ and implementing agencies. Additionally, Centres of Excellence can be established across geographies of the four countries focusing on specific sectors like cybersecurity, healthcare, and outer space. Lastly, the four countries would need to institute legislations pertaining to taxation, customs, and arbitration to facilitate project implementation.

As an alternative to the dismal performance of most multilateral institutions, minilaterals like I2U2 provide hope for more effective and mutually beneficial international cooperation. Keeping in mind the global nature of challenges faced by countries across the world, a platform like the I2U2 can provide a sound framework to explore opportunities, support collective resolution of global challenges, and unlock avenues for greater convergence of interests and actions between countries.

India is followed by South Korea, Japan, Panama, and the United States (US) at the 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th positions respectively.

The report, released by former Vice President (VP) of India Venkaiah Naidu in November 2022, is based on conceptual issues relating to human rights, minorities, the concept of religious freedom and cultural dilemma of religious minorities, causes of religious differences and more.

Key Points:

i.Maldives, Afghanistan, and Somalia are at the bottom of the list.

ii.The United Kingdom(UK) and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are at positions 54 and 61, respectively.

However, there have been reports of conflict between the majority and minority communities.

iv.The report noted that the United Nations (UN) may use India’s minority policy as a model for other nations due to the model’s inclusiveness and lack of discrimination against many religions and their sects.

v.The purpose of this report is also to educate the world community on the prevalence of discrimination against minorities based on their faith in different nations.

Curtailing Pollution is Essential to Reduce Superbugs: UNEP Report

According to the recent report released by United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), Bracing for Superbugs: strengthening environmental action in the One Health response to antimicrobial resistance, reduction of pollution created by pharmaceuticals, agricultural and healthcare sectors is essential to reduce the emergence, transmission and spread of superbugs, a strain of bacteria which has become resistant to every known antibiotic.

Superbugs are other instances of Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR).

The report was released during the Sixth Meeting of the Global Leaders Group on AMR held in Barbados.

Antimicrobial Resistance (AMR):

i.Antimicrobials are essential in reducing the burden of infectious diseases in humans, animals and plants.

ii.It is estimated that in 2019 around 1.27 million deaths were attributed to drug-resistant infection and 4.95 million deaths were associated with bacterial AMR.

iii.It is estimated that AMR causes around 10 million additional direct deaths annually by 2050.

iv.The AMR is also expected to result in a GDP drop of at least USD 3.4 trillion annually by 2030 and push around 24 million more people into extreme poverty.

One Health Response:

i.The report calls for a multisectoral One Health response which recognises that the health of people, animals, plants and the environment are closely related and interdependent.

The One Health Joint Plan of Action was launched by the Quadripartite Alliance, including UNEP, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH).

ii.One Health response to AMR will reduce the risk and burden of AMR on humans and nature and will help to address the triple planetary crisis.

iii.The triple planetary crisis entails higher temperatures and extreme weather patterns, land-use changes that alter its microbial diversity, as well as biological and chemical pollution.

Skye Air launches “Skye UTM”, India’s First Traffic Management System for Drones On 7th February 2023, Skye Air Mobility Private Limited(Skye Air), a Gurugram (Haryana)-based drone solutions provider, launched India’s first traffic management system for drones, named “Skye UTM”.

Skye UTM, was launched in the presence of Nitin Gadkari, Union Minister of Road Transport and Highways.

The system, Skye UTM, will allow drone operators to plan routes, make flight plans and assess risks before running drone-based operations in India.

Key Highlights:

i. The control of airspace will rely on unmanned traffic management systems, which will enable multiple beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) drone operations to be run simultaneously by different firms.

Such systems are provided globally by several companies, including United States(US)-based AirMap and Netherlands-based Airbus.

ii. Ankit Kumar, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Skye Air, claims that the programme imports information from the government’s Digital Sky platform, which was developed to assist drone operators in planning flights in Indian airspace.

The Digital Sky platform, run by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA), was 1st introduced in 2018 and provides users with essential knowledge for conducting drone missions in India.

iii. Skye UTM will allow operators a “better understanding” of where they can fly. The software has been tested on over 300 successful BVLOS flights.

iv. The information on drone flights planned through Skye UTM will also be shared with authorities before a take-off.

After an operator submits the flight plan, information on the drone license number, drone operator’s contact, flight plan, purpose of flight, and duration and time of flight on Skye UTM, the information will be shared with the Airports Authority of India (AAI), which can then reject a flight if it finds inconsistencies or possible disruptions with aircraft/helicopter operations.

v.Skye UTM is a Cloud-based aerial traffic management system that integrates unmanned air traffic with the manned aviation airspace

BVLOS:

Beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) refers to drone flights where the pilot cannot see the drone.

They enable firms to run drone missions over longer distances, which is necessary for logistics, the delivery of medicines, and more.

Skye UTM will also offer latitude and longitude data, which is unavailable on Digital Sky.

Skye Air Offer:

Skye Air also offers remote ID services to track drones, which is a piece of hardware that needs to be installed on drones to communicate real-time information on their location.

Kothagudem: Diversified conglomerate ITC as part of its social investments division, Mission Sunehra Kal (MSK) entered into a memorandum of understanding with the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) – Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR).

This industry-academia collaboration was aimed at strengthening ITC’s endeavours in soil and moisture conservation activities. MSK, Telangana Division has been carrying out a plethora of supply side management initiatives such as area treatment, tank distillation and water storage structures like farm ponds.

The organisation has also been promoting water use efficiency in agriculture, cost of cultivation that promote cost effective farm mechanization technologies to help to realise climate smart and resilient agriculture, said a statement from ITC here on Friday.

To enhance water use efficiency and minimise dependency on water for arable crops like paddy, ICAR- IIRR, a nodal agency in research, would provide its technical guidance for direct seeded rice (DSR) technology application in ITC intervention project fields across Telangana and AP.

The programme includes training and capacity building for farmers, frontline extension members and those who practice the DSR technology with relevant and emerging trends in climate smart farming.

The signing of MoU that took place at Rajendra Nagar, Hyderabad recently was attended by ICAR-IIRR Director Meenakshi Sundaram, crop improvement division head Dr. LV Subba Rao, ITC MSK regional manager Manjunath, its Telangana programme manager, Jaya Prakash Ramasamy and agriculture anchor leads Hemant and Sarvesh.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ITC-launches-integrated-ini.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/itc-msk-partners-with-icar-iirr-to-promote-climate-smart-farming

A team of experts from the Icrisat has done a pilot project on ‘scaling up climate-smart agriculture in the Telangana’ to highlight the importance of CSA in the rainfed farming systems.
After gathering information, the team conducted a climate risk analysis and implemented a multi-stakeholder participatory prioritisation of CSA practices.
Using the information, the team created maps to highlight the ‘hotspots’ or mandals at higher climate risk.
“This long-term climate analysis indicates high to very high climate risk in almost all the mandals in Nalgonda, Adilabad, Yadadri and Nagarkurnool districts,” the report said.","Contrary to popular belief, protecting agriculture against the adverse impacts of climate change is not a very costly proposition. Scientists at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) have conducted a pilot in the rain-fed districts of Telangana and called for promoting climate-smart villages (CSV) to ensure sustainable agricultural production by building resilience to climate change.

The project helped prioritise climate smart agriculture (CSA) practices for 8,000 farm households in Mahabubnagar district and the organisation has proposed a framework to apply the climate-smart village approach to other parts of the State.

It is about prioritising the spending based on policies on science and making investments that are important to mitigate the adverse impacts of climate change. “It won’t cost the exchequer a great deal of additional investment. It is about prioritising the investments on appropriate technologies in a context-specific manner, building farmers’ capacity and incentives for adaptation,” Shalander Kumar, Deputy Global Program Director at Icrisat, told BusinessLine.

He said that rainfed farming systems in Telangana were increasingly affected by high climate variability. “The current efforts to address this challenge are not unified. It’s important to imbibe a climate lens in all agricultural development plans and strategies. Science- policy interface, backed by data and analysis, and sensitisation of all stakeholders is the key to mainstream CSA into development planning action,” he said.

“Funds and subsidies are available to buy machines and other farm equipment. It is about what machinery and equipment to buy. It is about prioritisation,” he said.

After gathering information, the team conducted a climate risk analysis and implemented a multi-stakeholder participatory prioritisation of CSA practices. “This approach has the potential to be replicated across India and beyond,” Shalander Kumar said.

In order to improve the effectiveness of CSA practices, the team has done a climate exposure (or climate risk) assessment for baseline and mid-century climate conditions was carried out.

Division into grids

After dividing Telangana into 350 grids representing mandals, the team collected information on temperature changes, heat and cold wave events, rainfall variability and changes in the frequency or intensity of consecutive dry and wet days.

Using the information, the team created maps to highlight the ‘hotspots’ or mandals at higher climate risk. These hotspots would require immediate attention.

“This long-term climate analysis indicates high to very high climate risk in almost all the mandals in Nalgonda, Adilabad, Yadadri and Nagarkurnool districts,” the report said. “It is important that the climate smart and sustainable agriculture strategies become integral to the development and agricultural action plan from village to national level,” Shalander Kumar pointed out.

Hyderabad: ICRISAT has developed a mobile gaming app name MRIDA (Managing resources for integrated development of agriculture) to help smallholder farmers strategise climate-smart agricultural practices to enhance soil carbon that eventually increases yield and builds resilience.

“We are happy to partner with GIZ in bringing user-friendly technology that not only educates farmers on soil conservation but also captures farmers’ attitude to soil management practices in the face of climate change, providing valuable insights to policymakers and governments,” said Dr. Jacqueline Hughes, Director General, ICRISAT.

A team of scientists from the international organisation undertook a modelling study from 2020 to 2022 conducted in five districts of Maharashtra and eight districts of Odisha to develop the app, which promotes behavioural change for adopting climate-smart agriculture practices among farmers.

It was developed with funds sanctioned by the German Agency for International Cooperation to conduct a comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of agriculture management to determine their potential to sequester carbon (the process of capturing, securing, and storing atmospheric carbon dioxide from the atmosphere)

In addition to English, the gaming app that was developed, in collaboration with Vasudhaika Software Private Limited, will soon be available in Marathi.

Catering directly to the consumers’ needs assures better marketability and incomes. This is what nearly 10,000 farmers of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh have realised over the past decade and are now steering a silent organic movement.

It all began in 2009, when a group of consumers in Hyderabad, then part of unified Andhra Pradesh, established a cooperative society to source chemical-free produce directly from farmers.

Operating under the guidance of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture (CSA), a Hyderabad-based research non-profit, the cooperative society over a period of time roped in a few farmers and began to sell the produce through a farmer-run retail store in Secunderabad and mobile retail vans that travelled to urban areas.

Soon, more and more organic farmers joined the cooperative society and what had started off as a consumers’ initiative became a farmers’ group. In 2013, when the government floated the concept of farmer producer organisation (FPO) to aggregate collection of produce and create market links for better prices under the Companies Act of 2013, CSA and the cooperative society saw this as an opportunity.

Establishing an FPO also helps gain financial support from the government. Thus, in 2014, all the farmers’ groups under the cooperative society registered themselves as organic FPOs, and the society at the helm as Sahaja Aharam Producer Company Limited, a unique “federation” of organic FPOs.

That was the year when Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh. But Sahaja Aharam continued its operation as a federation with FPOs from both the states. Today, as many as 23 organic FPOS with over 9,000 farmers across 180 villages are part the federation.

The groups are spread over the southern plateau and hills of Andhra Pradesh, as well as the north, central and southern parts of Telangana. The farmers grow paddy, cereals, oilseeds, pulses, fruits, vegetables and spices.

To obtain membership, FPOs buy equity in the federation. A board of five directors coordinates operations at the federation level along with the heads of the FPOs and support from CSA.

Market is key

Since inception, Sahaja Aharam has realised that there is a growing market for organic produce that can help farmers earn more. So it provides marketing and retail support for certified organic produce. Some of its member-FPOs, though, market both conventional and organic produce.

The federation also encourages and helps farmers to obtain organic certification and trains them on cultivation of specific crops; weed, pest and disease management; and preparation of organic and biological inputs. Some farmers are also trained in poultry and livestock farming.

Venkat Reddy from Kallem village in Jangaon district, Telangana, who has converted 1.2 hectares (ha) of his 6.07 ha farm to organic, said, “There was an initial loss in paddy yield after the shift, but the cost has reduced from Rs 25,000 per 0.4 ha to Rs 15,000. Currently, I grow organic paddy for my own consumption. But after seeing other farmers get 10-15 per cent more income from this variety, I plan to bring in more area under it.”

Regenerative or chemical-free cultivation has helped improve the local environmental conditions as well. Enabavi village in Telangana’s Hanamkoda district, which declared itself as the first organic village in the region in 2006 is now entirely free of pesticides, fertilisers and genetically modified crops.

All 52 farmer families of the village have shifted 110 ha to regenerative agriculture by composting organic waste, using cow dung manure and pest-trapping crops and harvesting water. “This has led to a rise in soil fertility,” said GV Ramanjaneyulu, executive director of CSA.

With more farmers trying to benefit from regenerative agriculture, the federation is focused on helping its members gain a better market share. For this, it plans production strategies with its FPOs. It apprises them of trends in organic produce, sales figures and rates from the previous years.

“Unlike traditional FPOs, a lot of effort and business insight goes into production planning,” said Prasanna T P, chief executive of Sahaja Aharam. Further, to ensure quality, the federation tests 1 per cent of total produce for chemical pesticide residue.

“Sahaja Aharam buys my produce at 10-15 per cent higher price than the market,” said Vekanna Reddy, a farmer from Mulang village, Siddipet district, Telangana. The federation buys cereals, millets, pulses, vegetables and oilseeds at 10 per cent higher prices, which can increase based on quality. For paddy, rates can go higher.

The federation sells raw and processed products, which include food items, cosmetics and other non-food products. Some 45 per cent of the product range consists of organic fruits and vegetables. To set market prices, Sahaja Aharam follows two criteria.

First, the farmers’ share in the price must either be 50 per cent over the cost of cultivation, 12-15 per cent above the local market or 50 per cent of the average price in the previous year, whichever is highest.

For instance, it procures paddy crop from farmers at Rs 42 per kg and sells it for Rs 80 — cultivators earn more than half the retail price. Farmers are paid in two tranches, once during procurement and then after sale of products.

Second, to remain competitive, prices fixed by the federation are merely 15-20 per cent higher than those for conventional produce, but lower in comparison to those of some other organic players, particularly for pulses, groundnut oil and spices. Some 15 per cent of the price funds the federation’s operations.

For sales, the federation has expanded the retail stores. It now has two stores in Secunderabad and one each in Hyderabad and Visakhapatnam. Stores in Hyderabad and Secunderabad sell online as well. Their vans still operate in Hyderabad.

Sahaja Aharam also sells unlabelled produce in bulk to 110 aggregators. Currently, 55 per cent of sales are to bulk aggregators, 43 per cent through retail stores and 2 per cent online. Turnover has increased multifold over the last few years, from Rs 90.3 lakh 2018-19 to some Rs 2.61 crore in 2021-22.

Game-changer

The federation’s efforts to increase farm incomes go beyond market access.

“It has helped me re-learn sustainable farming techniques to increase yield. Earlier I used to earn Rs 29,600 per kg from paddy, now I earn Rs 33,000,” Krishan, a farmer from Jeedikal village in Jangaon district, who practices organic farming in his entire 2.8 ha, said. “I can save 50 per cent of cultivation costs, around Rs 10,000, by using organic inputs that I make,” he added.

The federation encourages farmers to grow traditional and new crops, based on water requirement, pest resistance, yield and market preferences. It also enables knowledge exchange and peer learning.

Further, it has introduced a mobile application called Pestoscope and set up surveillance centres in villages, and shares weather predictions from the India Meteorological Department and states. Sahaja Aharam also introduced an enterprise resource planning tool in 2018, developed by CSA, to manage production, finances, warehousing, sales and data analysis.

To diversify incomes and provide more livelihood opportunities, the federation has set up “food hubs” at six districts in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana for storage and processing. It is also diversifying its product range to include ready-to-eat and non-food products.

The federation provides several lessons on hand-holding support, storage, processing and marketing, however, like other FPOs in the country, it faces challenges such as poor financial support and lack of skilled humanpower. Addressing these hurdles will help it grow better.

(This is the second in a series of multiple reports that show how better market access to non-chemical produce is key to the success of regenerative agriculture)

One out of every three farmers in Telangana are tenant farmers, an extensive survey of the extent of tenancy in the state has found.

The figure is double the National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO) survey estimates of 17.5 per cent tenant holdings in the state. Also, these tenant farmers were found to be excluded from all government support.

The Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), an independent farmers’ organisation based in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, conducted a door-to-door survey in collaboration with other organisations.

Read Compensate Telangana farmers immediately for crop loss: Farm activists

They covered 7,744 farmers in 34 villages across 20 districts. They found 36 per cent (2,753) were cultivating leased land. This means that the projected total number of tenant farmers was 2.2 million, double the NSSO estimate. Also, 19 per cent of these were landless.

The 36 per cent figure will make Telangana the second state after Andhra Pradesh with such high tenant holdings in the country. Tenant farmers, on average, owned 0.9 hectare (ha) of land. Average leased land was two ha.

Eighty-one per cent owned some land. But since it was not sufficient for livelihood, they had to rent some additional land. Of this, marginal farmers (with less than 1 ha) were 48 per cent and small farmers (owning between 1-2 ha) were 24 per cent.

Some 31 per cent of the tenants had leased in more than two ha of land, which showed that the tenant farmers were more dependent on the leased land than their own land.

The survey also highlighted that while on one hand, there is mounting debt on tenant farmers, they do not get any substantial government support which is mostly given to land-owning farmers.

Average debt due to agriculture per tenant farmer family was Rs 2.7 lakh. Of this, 75 per cent were private loans.

The interest on private loans ranges from 24 per cent to 60 per cent, with tenant farmers being dependent on moneylenders, fertiliser and pesticides dealers, gold pawnbrokers, commission agents, relatives, seed companies, and landowners for their investment.

However, there was no direct or indirect benefit of the Rythu Bandhu scheme, a direct cash benefit transfer scheme of the Telangana government. It goes only to the land title holder directly.

The state government had claimed that the scheme would indirectly benefit tenant farmers, as landowners who received cash support will either give part of it to tenant farmers or reduce the land rent. However, only 17 farmers (0.6 per cent) said the lease price was reduced.

Just 10 tenants (0.4 per cent) said the land owner gave the entire Rythu Bandhu money to them. Only 0.1 per cent of tenant farmers said they were given a portion of Rythu Bandhu.

Read Telangana farmers pushed to suicide after pest attack destroys chilli crop

Down To Earth also found the trend during its reportage in the state on pest attacks on chilli crop early this year. The government did not give any compensation for heavy crop damage to the tenant farmers, scores of whom had died by suicide.

The survey too said while 77 per cent of farmers suffered severe crop damage in the last three years, only one per cent received compensation.

A crucial loss to the farmers was also that 44 per cent couldn’t sell their crop at minimum support price because procurement was tied to land ownership.

Over 60 per cent of tenant farmers were from backward classes, 23 per cent from Scheduled Castes and 10 per cent belonged to Scheduled Tribes.

“The context of the study is that while we observe increasing extent of tenant farmers cultivating leased land at the field level, the Telangana state government has excluded them from all their support systems.

“The government has declared an explicit stand that their schemes are meant only for land owning farmers and not for tenant farmers – saying that taking care of tenant farmers is not the government’s responsibility,” the report said.

The Government of Telangana has declared its flagship Rythu Bandhu cash transfer scheme to be an “investment support scheme” to help farmers pay for the costs of inputs and cultivation.

“But the money goes only to the land owners (pattadars) even if they are not cultivating the land, while excluding the actual cultivators,” the report said.

The 2011 Land Licensed Cultivators Act required the government to identify and register actual cultivators and issue them Loan and Other Eligibility Cards (LEC) to access bank loans and other schemes. However, after 2015, the state government stopped implementing the Act.

Chief Minister KC Rao declared in the Assembly that it was not possible to register and identify the tenant farmers as they lease land from one owner for one year and another year from another owner.

However, the survey found that 73 per cent of the tenant farmers had been cultivating the same land for at least three years or more. Of this, 39 per cent farmers have been farming on the same land for more than five years and 18 per cent for more than 10 years.

Even the central government does not include tenant farmers in its flagship PM-KISAN cash support scheme. But states like Odisha and Andhra Pradesh have maintained lists of tenant farmers and extended support through state schemes.",,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/1-out-of-3-farmers-are-tenants-in-telangana-are-excluded-from-any-government-support-86572

He will sell these to the nearest oil processing unit and make quick money. Not too far away, Mohammad Salim is growing paddy over four acres of his agricultural land.

This is a common sight in Khammam and now across agricultural land in Telangana as well – large tracts of paddy fields interspersed with patches of young and old oil palm fields.

After a push for paddy crop over the past few years, the Telangana government is now boosting oil palm cultivation. Both paddy and oil palm are water-intensive crops. In line with the plan to increase cultivation of these crops, Telangana has also increased irrigation facilities, over the past eight or so years, from 2014, when Andhra Pradesh and Telangana were bifurcated into separate states.

Studies and government records suggest that agriculture in Telangana is moving away from traditional crops like oil seeds, pulses and vegetables, which were commonly grown in this region, towards paddy and oil palm in recent years.

According to the latest annual socio-economic outlook of the state, production of paddy has increased by 378% between 2015-16 and 2020-21 in Telangana. Meanwhile, the production of oil palm has increased almost three times from 75,447 metric tonnes in 2015-’16 to 2,08,826 metric tonnes in 2020-’21. During the same period, the annual report shows that the percentage of gross sown area of traditional crops such as groundnut, Bengal gram and sesamum, continued to decrease.

Water intensive crops

Oil palm is a water intensive crop, with one tree requiring 200 litres to 300 litres of water per day. While this may be lower than what the typical water intensive crops such as sugarcane and paddy requires, it is still a considerable amount that could impact water resources.

On March 7, the Telangana government presented its state budget and allocated Rs 10 billion for the current fiscal year, exclusively for expanding oil palm plantation in the state. T Harish Rao, the state finance minister who presented the budget, said, in his speech, that until 2014, the region that is now Telangana had issues of drought and lack of irrigation, but current irrigation facilities in the state have improved.

Rao in his speech said, “In 2014, water was available only for (irrigating) 20 lakh acres (of agricultural land) in Telangana. By 2021, this has increased to 85.89 lakh acres.” He also said that owing to the growing demand for palm oil as well as increased irrigation potential in the state, Telangana plans to expand land under oil palm cultivation.

According to the state government’s latest plan, it has planned to bring 20 lakh acres of land under oil palm plantation in the next five years against the existing 90,000 acres. The government, in the latest budget, also highlighted what is currently the world’s largest multi-stage lift irrigation project, Kaleshwaram, on Godavari river basin and other irrigation projects which helped in boosting irrigation in the state.

However, it is not only the state government who wants expansion of oil palm in Telangana, but also the federal government that has given a target of adding three lakh (3,00,000) acres of land for oil palm in the next five years under the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm scheme. A central re-assessment committee with members from The Indian Council of Agricultural Research’s constituent organisation, India Institute of Oil Palm Research, in 2021, had recommended expanding oil palm plantation from four districts of Telangana to 27 districts of the state owing to the increased irrigation facilities.

Currently, Telangana is second in India, after Andhra Pradesh, in the quantity of palm oil it produces. According to data from the directorate of agriculture and farmers welfare, Andhra Pradesh produced 2,95,075 metric tonnes of crude palm oil in 2021-’22, the highest in India, which was followed by Telangana which produced 46,171 metric tonnes during the same period.

Likely ecological threats

But what does this transition of Telangana agriculture from traditional crops to commercial and water intensive crops such as paddy and oil palm mean for the state’s environment and agriculture?

The Telangana state horticulture department says that an increase in oil palm plantation will not pose a hazard to the state’s agriculture and ecology. “In the other largest (palm oil) producing countries in the world like Malaysia and Indonesia, the story was different where due to expansion of oil palm, there was deforestation. But in Telangana, we are mainly boosting oil palm on agricultural land. Also, irrigation facilities in the state have increased manifold in the last few years. We are also judicious about not using these plants in urban areas of six of the water deficient districts of the state. This will only help in giving better financial security to the farmers,” an official from the state horticulture department said, on the condition of anonymity.

However, experts from the agriculture and water sector have apprehensions about the proposed plan of the state government and the Union government to expand oil palm plantation in the state on a large scale.

Devinder Sharma, a noted agriculture and food policy expert from Chandigarh claimed that the whole policy of supporting a crop like oil palm that requires a significant amount of water is a “wrongly conceived” idea, which could have alarming consequences in the state in future. “This is the same kind of mistake Punjab made decades ago. Intensive cropping of water-guzzling plants like paddy has led to decreased groundwater levels in this state. Why are states like Telangana trying to make the same kind of mistakes and become the next Punjab in the years to come? In Telangana, there is short sightedness. If there is an increase in irrigation and better water availability, we should not ruthlessly exploit and literally allow mining of water resources thereby depriving our future generations of the precious resource,” he told Mongabay-India.

He also added, “In the race to compete with other states to commercialise production, they are on their way to destroy agriculture. Moreover, it has been done for a cheaper and sub-standard edible oil. It is always better to boost our own high quality edible oil crops to minimise the gap between total domestic production and total consumption.”

The groundwater level in Telangana is not significantly impacted so far. Since 2018, the depth to the ground water level has been decreasing, which means the water level itself has been increasing. Experts that Mongabay-India spoke to claim it is because of the good rain the state had been receiving. According to government data, the state received 46% excess rainfall in 2020-’21 and normal rainfall in the last five years, leading to timely recharge of groundwater.

But there could be other factors that increase the demand for groundwater. For example, studies have indicated that even 1% increase in average temperature due to reasons like climate change, could lead to 10% additional demand for irrigated water in arid and semi-arid areas. Telangana is a semi-arid region, according to the state government.

Water blues

Experts claimed that owing to the geography of Telangana, a focus on water intensive agriculture could impact the water resources, including groundwater, significantly in the future, in addition to having other environmental impacts. Telangana, in the Deccan plateau, is situated on an elevation and the government in the state had been using lift irrigation and other ways to pull water from rivers to cater to the large irrigation needs of the state. The demand for irrigation is likely to increase with the increase in oil palm cultivation.

Himanshu Thakker, Coordinator, South Asia Network on Dams, Rivers and People, told Mongabay-India, “In Telangana most of the cultivable land is situated at a higher altitude, so there is a need to pump water from the rivers to irrigate many of these lands. That is why even the Kaleshwaram dam is mostly pumping water from lower to higher altitude rather than acting as a dam to provide gravity flow irrigation. This is very energy intensive and not sustainable in the long run. Large scale lift irrigation projects have not been successful in the majority of the areas where they were tried.”

Studies have shown that in the past few decades the practice of using wells as sources of water for irrigation, compared to tanks, canals and other sources, has been significantly increasing in this region, that’s now part of Telangana. In 2015-’16, which is up to when the data is available, over 86% of area irrigated in the Telangana region used wells as the source. Several oil palm farmers that Mongabay-India met at Khammam, Suryapet and other parts of Telangana mostly use their wells to irrigate their oil palm fields. Thakker said that the government needs to regulate the use of groundwater resources like wells and tubewells to make the farming sustainable.

He said, “Whenever there is availability of groundwater, there is an increase in the number of tube wells and wells. It is a slow poison, and it takes time to show alarming impacts. The groundwater use needs to be regulated at the local level. There needs to be more groundwater recharge. The better way for the government is to go for decentralised rain water harvesting systems. Since the rainfall is good in Telangana, this is a much better option.”

Ramanjaneyulu GV, an agricultural scientist at the Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture said that Andhra Pradesh tops the list of oil palm production in the country because of the favourable conditions the state offers, unlike Telangana.

“If you see Andhra, most of the oil palm plantations are spread in coastal belts of the state because it requires moisture. In Telangana which is an arid region, there is less moisture and dry weather. In such conditions, the yields are likely to be lower and also in future the farmers could face problems like lack of water for irrigation. As these are long gestation period crops, this could harm the state more than benefiting it,” he said.

He added, “Two years back the same thrust was given by the government for farmers on increasing paddy cultivation, when irrigation in the state increased, and now the focus has shifted towards oil palm. State should not push for a particular crop, and let the farmers make their own choice. When the state pushes, it is the seed suppliers who make more incomes than farmers. It happens all over.”

Karimnagar: Farm labourers from Uttar Pradesh are praising the farmer-friendly schemes being implemented in Telangana.

The labourers, who migrated here to work in paddy plantations in a big way across the State, were impressed by the welfare schemes and facilities being provided to the agriculture sector by the State government.

Pointing out that apart from free 24 hour power supply, schemes like Rythu Bandhu, Rythu Bima and adequate water for agriculture fields through irrigation projects were helping farmers here a lot, they said there were no such schemes being implemented in Uttar Pradesh.

A 13-member team of labourers from Tanakpur road, Neoria Husainpur, Pilibhit district of UP, have been engaged in paddy plantation in different areas of the district during the last few weeks. Speaking to Telangana today, one of them, Ashid Bairagi, said that besides Telangana, they had worked in paddy fields in Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka and other States over the last few years. Not just UP, but no other State was implementing such schemes for the welfare of farmers, he said.

They were not getting much work in UP since paddy was being cultivated in a smaller area, which was why they were forced to migrate to Telangana and other States to earn a livelihood. Moreover, they were getting double income in Telangana. They would get only Rs.350 as daily wages in UP, while in Telangana, they were getting Rs.600 per day, Bairagi said.

Another labourer, Golak Mandal, said that earlier, they used to frequently go to AP, but were coming to Telangana during the last four years. Compared to other States, more facilities were being provided to farmers in Telangana, he said.

Apart from this, the atmosphere in the State too was pleasant and the people were friendly, said Rina Mandal, adding that they would stay for three months in the State for work.

Meanwhile, local agents are engaging labourers from UP, West Bengal, Bihar, Odisha and Chhattisgarh to work in paddy fields here. Besides providing shelter, cooking gas and rice, labourers are being given Rs.3,500 to Rs.4,500 per team for plantation of paddy in an acre of land. Each team works on four to five acres every day, with the agents charging Rs.900 to Rs.1,000 per acre as commission from the labourers.

A farmer from Ramakrishna Colony of Thimmapur mandal, Gujjula Srinivas Reddy said local labourers were charging Rs.5,800 to sow paddy in an acre of land. However, migrant workers would do the same work at much lesser rates.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/labourers.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/uttar-pradesh-labourers-praise-telanganas-agriculture-schemes

06 January 2023, Telangana: As part of its commitment to make farming communities more sustainable, FMC Corporation recently announced that it has inaugurated two new water filtration plants in the Indian state of Telangana. The first plant is in the village Ramnagar in Telangana’s Hanumakonda district while the second is in Sangam Banda, in the Narayanpet district.

With the capacity to produce 500 liters of filtered water per hour, the two newly constructed water filtration plants are expected to reduce waterborne diseases and make a significant difference to the health of 900 villagers in total. The initiative is part of Project Samarth, FMC’s community outreach program in India. Project Samarth seeks to increase access to clean, potable water for farming communities.

“Project Samarth is an expression of our commitment to better living standards of Indian farmers and their families sustainably,” said Mr. Ravi Annavarapu, President of FMC India. “Since 2019, FMC has commissioned more than 60 filtration plants in villages across Uttar Pradesh, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh and Punjab. With the positive response received over the years, the initiative is now also being extended to villages in Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh. We believe that these water filtration plants will make a tangible positive difference in the health index of the villages in time to come. We aim to make safe and potable drinking water accessible to 300,000 farmer families across the country by 2023.”

Each family registered as a beneficiary under Project Samarth receives an “Any Time Water” (ATW) swipe card, which releases 20 liters with each swipe. FMC is also actively involved in a door-to-door campaign to raise awareness among villagers about the benefits of drinking water that meets clean drinking water standards.

The two new water filtration plants were inaugurated by FMC India’s field and Community Development Foundation teams, as well as local dignitaries.

The fruiting of mango trees also follows a similar south to north pattern, the expert added.
Such high precipitation and subsequent humidity send a false stimulus to the mango trees that the weather conditions are favourable for flowering.
“Warm temperatures, apart from unseasonal rainfall, can also induce flowering in mango trees,” said Chandran.
Mango trees in various regions had shown unusual flowering characteristics in February this year as well.","Normally, flowering of mango trees begins in southern Kerala around this time

Mango flowering has started since the third week of December in Telangana and Odisha, which is at least a month sooner than the normal period of flowering.

Unseasonal rainfall and a warmer-than-normal winter — both imprints of a changing climate — may be responsible for such anomalous flowering, according to experts.

Usually flowering of mango trees begins in southern Kerala around this time, MD Subash Chandran, professor of ecology at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore told Down To Earth (DTE).

“This is because flowering requires warmth and humidity, which is readily available in Kerala during this period. From here the flowering spreads northward, and northwest India witnesses flowering last,” he said. The fruiting of mango trees also follows a similar south to north pattern, the expert added.

In the northern parts of the peninsular region such as Telangana and Odisha, this is usually a dry period. So, flowering is early and highly unusual. But in the week from December 8-14, 2022 there was large excess rainfall in 16 out of the 33 districts of Telangana, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

In Rangareddy district, where DTE observed flowering, there was 735 per cent more rainfall than normal, the national weather agency reported.

Such high precipitation and subsequent humidity send a false stimulus to the mango trees that the weather conditions are favourable for flowering. This can trigger the trees to sprout flowers even though it is unseasonal.

Flowering usually happens after the coldest period of the season is ending, heralding spring. This again shows that the period this year is warmer than usual for Telangana and Odisha. “Warm temperatures, apart from unseasonal rainfall, can also induce flowering in mango trees,” said Chandran.

“Under the influence of climate shift, early and delayed flowering is a characteristic feature of mango,” said a research paper published in the journal Ecology Environment and Conservation in March 2016.

Read more: Mango trees are flowering well this season; why then are farmers worried?

“Two of the most important factors determining suitability of an area’s climate for mango are air temperature and rainfall. The sequence of phenological (plant growth) changes is either advanced or retarded with the rise and fall in temperature and the onset of wet and dry seasons,” according to the report.

Therefore, climate change is likely to influence phenological patterns and indirectly vegetative and reproductive processes leading to reduced quality and quantity of production, the scientists argued.

Mango trees in various regions had shown unusual flowering characteristics in February this year as well. The flowering was intense, with some places reporting flowers and fruits sprouting together on some trees.

This, DTE had reported, was an indication of the coming stormy season and intense summer. The current early flowering could also bring similar conditions, a section of the experts think.

The farmers of Telangana have faced unprecedented crop losses in the wake of heavy rains and floods this month. The government should immediately compensate them, an independent farmers’ organisation based in the two Telugu states said July 23, 2022.

Activists of the Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) also called out the Telangana government’s policies towards farmers.

They addressed a press conference in Hyderabad where they released a factsheet on the claims made by the state and the Centre. The claims dealt with disaster relief, the State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF).

The organisation called on both the Centre and state, who have been engaged in a political slugfest, to bury the hatchet and ensure that disaster relief reaches lakhs of affected farmers.

Telangana has been hit by flooding twice in a fortnight now. The first round of flooding happened around July 15 along the Godavari river. On July 22 and 23, heavy rains inundated low-lying areas in Hyderabad and its neighbouring districts such as Medak, Sangareddy and Mahbubabad.

The Met Department has said Telangana is set to get more rains over the next three days. The state’s north and north-eastern districts are set to receive heavy rains and a red alert has been issued for north Telangana districts, Met Department director K Nagaratna told this reporter.

“Up to 20 centimetres of rain is expected in some places. We have given a flood warning for the state. As of now, we have received 119 per cent rainfall and Nizamabad and Karimnagar districts have received highest rains,” she added.

Flawed policies

The RSV expressed concern over extensive damage to cotton, maize, soyabean and red gram crops due to the heavy rains and overflowing waterbodies.

The activists cited preliminary reports of crop damages over 445,154 hectares across the state. They sought immediate enumeration of crops, livestock and lands affected.

They also criticised the government’s lack of data regarding tenant farmers.

“Details of actual cultivators including tenant farmers should be noted down immediately. The Telangana government has refused to implement the Licensed Cultivators Act 2011 and failed to identify lakhs of tenant farmers,” Kiran Vissa, from the RSV, who is in the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee, said.

“It would be difficult for the government to zero in on tenant farmers and pay compensation in the future if not done soon. Not doing so now would only lead to the government taking the plea of being too late,” he added.

The activists also took exception to giving a go-by to the standard practice of farmer-wise enumeration of crop loss immediately after a disaster.

They said this had led to a handicap even when funds were available. Compensation was provided in 2018 in Adilabad and Khammam districts purely owing to the initiative of the district collectors as they had data and most of the amount went to those districts, the RSV said.

They also highlighted the issue of crop insurance schemes. Telangana exited the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana from the kharif season of 2020.

However, it had failed to establish its own schemes unlike other states such as Andhra Pradesh, West Bengal, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu. Its farmers thus had not received any compensation despite heavy losses.

Kanneganti Ravi, RSV activist said taking the Telangana government to the High Court for the State of Telangana twice over the past four years over payment of compensation to farmers had not resulted in changing its attitude. In 2018, it was forced to distribute a meagre Rs 23 crore as input subsidy.

“The state went on appeal to the Supreme Court after it lost the case and failed to pay the Rs 188.23 crore for crop losses approved by the Centre between July and September 2021. This despite the state’s crop damage assessment of Rs 552 crore according to the NDRF scale of relief,” Ravi said.

He added that this exposed the claims of generosity by the Centre to the state. “The state government’s failure to fulfil its promise to waive farmers loans has resulted in denial of fresh loans from banks to farmers,” he added.

Telangana has failed to adhere to norms laid down according to guidelines issued in July 2015 and failed to submit reports of expenditure incurred.

Funds according to norms are released by the NDRF, subject to spending of 50 per cent of funds available with the SDRF.

As the SDRF had Rs 977 crore on March 31, 2020 (according to the state accountant general’s letter) and the approved Rs 245.96 crore was less than 50 per cent of the amount, new funds were not released by the Centre. This laid bare, the claim of lack of central assistance for disasters, the RSV factsheet said.

It further said the state government had made mutually contradictory statements in the apex court. It claimed lack of assistance from the Centre despite submission of damages.

At the same time, it said the entire affected crop was recovered completely in October 2020. It thus deduced no need for compensation payment and added that it was too late to identify the farmers now.

This stand has continued despite pronouncements by the state agriculture minister. He had made them after visiting chilli and fruit farmers in Warangal in the aftermath of a hailstorm in January 2022.

Chief Minister K Chandra Sekhar Rao had also seconded this proposal. But farmers are yet to receive any compensation.

The RSV also pooh-poohed the claims of the Telangana government over non-cooperation by the Centre in disbursal of relief funds. They showed a letter from the accountant general to the Union Ministry of Home Affairs as proof.

The letter noted the SDRF had a balance of Rs 977 crore on April 1, 2020. It also received Rs 449 crore from the Centre for 2020-21, Rs 149.67 crore from the state for 2020-21 and Rs 10,005 crore diverted from the Telangana Building and Other Workers Welfare Board, which is said to be against established norms.

The RSV said the state should immediately submit its pending accounts for earlier expenditure from SDRF and their current status. If the funds have been spent on Covid pandemic relief, the same should be made public. They also called on the Centre to immediately release full assistance for disaster relief.

Absence of such relief would only add to the growing number of farmer suicides, especially of tenant farmers, B Kondal Reddy, convenor of RSV, said.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-07-23/0.61926800_1658588730_telangana.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/compensate-telangana-farmers-immediately-for-crop-loss-farm-activists-83899

Swami Shitikantananda of Ramakrishna Math called upon farmers to save mother earth and pass it on safely to the coming generations.

“Soil is not a resource but a legacy that we have inherited from our ancestors, and to be handed over safely to the future generations. Farmers need to reduce the use of pesticides as involves violence against beneficial insects like bees and butterflies. Promote non-chemical agriculture,” said the Swamiji addressing a group of scientists after inaugurating a seminar on ‘Harnessing the Potential of Panchabhutas (tatvas) for Sustainable Climate Resilient Rainfed Agriculture’ held at the Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) on Wednesday.

Dr. V.K. Singh, Director, ICAR-CRIDA, emphasised the importance of panchabhutas - kshiti, pawan, sameer, jal and gagan - in sustainable rain-fed agriculture. He further mentioned that crop production is essentially harnessing of sun’s energy, by plants using carbon dioxide from air, and water.

Dr. M.C. Varshneya, former Vice-Chancellor, Kamadhenu University, and Anand Agricultural University, said that when panchabhutas are in harmonious balance, crop production is bountiful. Disruption of this balance leads to crop stresses that lower production and deterioration of soil, water and air quality. Climate change is one such disruptor that alters the ‘energy’ in the plant environment and the balancing of the panchabhutas neutralises the impact of climate change and leads to climate resilient agriculture, he said.

Dr. Pramod Chaudhari, president, Bharatiya Agro Economic Research Centre, said: Our ancestors had a deep understanding of panchabhutas and how they affect every aspect of human life, including agriculture.

Like, many other tenant farmers Rajput will not get any compensation for his loss.","Unseasonal or high intensity rainfall is regularly damaging crops across India over the past few years.

Usually, farmers get some compensation for the damage. But the primarily landless farmers and tenant farmers working on leased land do not qualify for compensation from the government as only those who own the land get compensated for crop loss because of weather events.

Giving farmland on lease is illegal in many states of India. Farming on another person’s land is done through informal or verbal contracts with shared benefits.

Ram Sagar, 64, a farmer who lives in Turkauli village of Barabanki district in Uttar Pradesh, lost three and a half acres of paddy crop due to heavy, unseasonal rains in October 2022. Another resident of the village, 42-year-old Jabir Ali, also lost an acre of paddy. As per the state government’s promise, Sagar will soon get the compensation, but Ali, a contract farmer farming on someone else’s land, will not get any.

The story of Channu Lal Rajput of Thekua village of Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh, about 15 kilometres from Turkauli, is like that of Ali. He had taken 2.5 acres of land on contract, but the crop suffered heavy damage due to intense rain. And just like many other tenant farmers, locally known as bataidaars, Rajput too will not get any compensation for his loss.

Standing in almost knee-deep water, Rajput, 50, cursed the day he had taken up paddy cultivation on contract. Heavy rains in October destroyed his ripened crop. In 2022, his wheat and mentha crops also got damaged due to extreme rainfall.

“I do not own even an inch of land. I had to give the farm owner 12 quintals (1,200 kilograms) of paddy for his land. This is part of the verbal agreement with the landowner. I spent about Rs. 30,000 on cultivating this, but I do not think I will even recover the cost,” he told. Rajput had taken Rs 30,000 from a moneylender in July-August 2022 at 5% interest. He calculated that if he manages to harvest 50-55 quintals of rice from the farm, he would have enough to give to the farm owner and would get sufficient for his need as well. But now Rajput and many more like him are in deep trouble.

Since the last few years, weather events such as floods, drought, excessive rainfall, and unseasonal rains have taken a toll on the farm sector, and the farmers are facing losses.

A senior official from the Uttar Pradesh Relief Commissioner office told Mongabay-India on December 6, 2022, that crops of 1.1 million farmers in 51 districts were damaged due to heavy rains and floods in October that year, affecting about 80,000 hectares of land. The state government released Rs. 200 crores (Rs. two billion) for 42,000 hectares of the affected land while the process is on for the rest of the area.

But this does not signal any relief for contract farmers. A Lekhpal (local Revenue Assistant), Nripendra Yadav, who is from a village close to the Ghaghra river in Sitapur district, told Mongabay-India that “In case of crop loss, only those who own the land will get compensation. Because on entering the gata number or khasra number (a unique number assigned to a parcel of land in rural areas) on the government’s portal, only the registered name is considered as the beneficiary. There is no rule for the contractor.”

Mongabay-India further confirmed the same with the Relief Commissioner’s office in Uttar Pradesh. A senior officer stated, “We work under the guidelines of central government’s disaster management policy, in which there are no specifications for landless or tenant farmers.”

These guidelines mean that several farmers, such as Rajput and Ali, will not receive compensation for their crop loss due to weather events. Farmers like them take the land of others on contract to do farming and, in return, give the owners a share of the crop or a fixed monetary amount. Most of the work of farming on other’s land is through informal or verbal contracts, which are not legally valid. In this arrangement, the entire risk is of the cultivator.

Compensation is not the only pain of these farmers – they are also left out of government schemes. For instance, the tenant farmers neither get the Rs. 6,000 per year from the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi nor get an agriculture loan (KCC) at 4%, as is provided for farmers. They are also not entitled to crop insurance schemes. The scheme says, “To provide income support to all landholding farmers’ families in the country, having cultivable land.”

Limited data

Though there are millions of such farmers across the country the government claims to have no clear data on landless and and migrant farmers.

On July 26, 2022, while replying to a parliament question about landless farmers or plans to enroll such farmers with government schemes, Union Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said, “There is no specific survey/enumeration of landless farmers and migrant landless farmers in the country.”

“Hence the actual number is not available. But according to the agriculture census 2015-16, the number of fully leased holdings in the country is 531,285, which means these are the only holdings (fields) whose officially written contract has been made.”

Despite the lack of this data, there are other surveys indicating that the share of leased holdings is increasing in the country. According to the National Statistical Office (NSO) report Situation Assessment of Agricultural Households survey for 2018-19, 17.3% of the country’s total 101.98 million hectares of operational land holding (land for agricultural production) is leased-in land. It is 13% of the total cultivable land of the country. As per the NSO data, 9.9% of operational holding was leased-in in 2002-03. It increased to 13.7% in 2012-13 and 17.3% in 2018-19.

In India, there are two prevalent ways of leasing-in land where a household takes land on rent or for free without any right of permanent or heritable possession. Sharecropping is a traditional arrangement where both the landowner and farmer pool in resources and the input cost and yield are divided between them. In the other arrangement, a tenant farmer undertakes farming on another person’s land, in turn paying rent, share crop yield, or tax.

Climate change increasing vulnerability

The kharif (monsoon crop) 2022 season is not the first-time farmers’ crops have been damaged. Early in the year, untimely rains hit potato and mustard crops in India. Farmers were not spared in March too when the country witnessed the hottest month in the past 122 years. The heat waves decreased the production of wheat.

Govardhan, an elderly farmer from Muda Kala village in the Sitapur district of Uttar Pradesh, said, “If the crop fails, nothing (compensation or insurance) is available. The entire paddy crop has been ruined. In 2022, I lost my groundnut and sesame crops, which rotted due to excessive rains. We neither get crop insurance nor compensation.”

To support his family of 10 people, Govardhan does contract farming on five acres of land. In the last 2-3 years, he has faced crop loss due to unfavourable weather several times.

Two-thirds of India’s cultivable land is rainfed. Thus, there is a direct effect on agriculture in case of less or more rain, experts say.

Uttar Pradesh is the second-largest state in paddy production and accounts for one-third of the total wheat production. But both crops have come under the grip of seasonal climate fluctuations. During the sowing of paddy in 2022, it did not rain as required, and when the crop was somehow ready to ripen, the standing crop got ruined in September-October rainfall.

A 2022 report on climate change, by Climate Transparency, a global partnership of experts and NGOs, highlights the increasing vulnerabilities. It said that between 2016-2021, due to extreme weather events such as floods, droughts, cyclones, untimely rains, and landslides in India, crops were damaged over an area of 36 million hectares, which cost the country Rs $3.75 billion.

According to a 2019 IPCC special report on climate change and land, in a 1.5°C global warming scenario, India’s production of paddy, wheat, pulses, and coarse cereals could decline by about 9% by 2050.

Kiran Kumar Vissa, the co-founder of Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), a Hyderabad-based farmers’ organisation promoting sustainable farming, says that farmers facing adversities need to be saved. “Farming is a natural phenomenon, completely dependent on the weather. The sharecropper farmers are the most troubled by climate change because they do not get support from anywhere. If the sharecroppers do not get a support system, then agriculture in the country will be ruined, will go into the hands of the companies and the campaign to deal with the climate will also suffer,” he adds.

Arvind Kumar Singh, a veteran journalist, and a rural policy expert emphasised that if one looks at the plains of northern Indian rivers such as Ganga and Yamuna, one will find that “educated and less landholding families have left the villages.”

“Farming is dependent on common sharecroppers and tenants. The government may have given drought and flood compensation, but they will not be able to avail of it as it is going to the bank account of the farm owner. Even if the landholder farmers are facing a loss in farming, they still have a place to stand as they are beneficiaries of the government policies. But the sharecroppers do not have that access,” Singh added.

Is leasing of land allowed under Indian laws?

Giving land on lease for farming is strictly prohibited in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, and Telangana, although physically disabled people, widowed or divorced women, and armed forces personnel are exempt. Lease is illegal in Kerala, although some self-help groups are exempted. But it is not illegal in states such as Punjab, Maharashtra, Haryana, and Assam. Andhra Pradesh, Rajasthan, and West Bengal have simple laws regarding lease-sharing.

For the welfare of such farmers, to make it easier for them to take land on lease and link them to government schemes, in 2015, India’s planning commission (NITI Aayog) constituted a high-level Committee on the issue of agricultural land leasing under the chairmanship of late Dr. T. Haque, an agriculture economist. In October 2016, the committee in ‘Report of the Expert Committee and Model Law on Agricultural Land Leasing’ claimed, “Because there is no written agreement between the owner and the sharecropper, or the lessor of the land, the sharecroppers are unable to take advantage of any scheme.”

The Committee said that after the implementation of the Model Land Leasing Act, farming would be easier on shared/leased land, agricultural productivity and income of landless farmers will increase, and the country’s GDP will also get support.

In 2016, when the report of NITI Aayog came out, there was a discussion for the implementation of the Model Land Leasing Act in 10 states of the country. Several rounds of meetings also took place. This was also in the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement Ordinance, 2020 on Price Assurance and Agricultural Services, one of the three agricultural laws named Land Reform that came in 2020. Though, the government was forced to repeal these laws after the year-long protest by farmers.

While talking to Mongabay-India, former Union Minister of State for Agriculture Hukum Dev Narayan, termed the repeal of this law a big mistake. “The government had brought an agriculture law for such farmers who sow on the land of others. But then the farmers opposed it. Those who feared a loss due to these laws opposed them, and those who were to be benefited were supporting them. In such a situation, how will there be any initiative?”

However, Vissa says, “We have been demanding laws to protect the interest of tenant farmers. But, the central government tabled those Acts to protect the interests of corporates, thus, we opposed them. These laws could have made tenant farmers vulnerable further.”

Few initiatives, yet to bear fruit

Few states have taken initiatives to protect tenant farmers.

In 2011, Andhra Pradesh, which has the highest tenant hoarding (42.4%) and area leased in (36.4%), enacted a law to benefit sharecroppers. In 2014, Telangana, which was carved out of Andhra Pradesh, also implemented this scheme for one year.

A co-founder of Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV), a Hyderabad-based farmers’ organisation promoting sustainable farming, Kiran Kumar Vissa explained that, in 2019, the Andhra Pradesh government repealed the 2011 Bataidar Act and implemented a new law, AP Crop Cultivator Rights law 2019, on the recommendation of NITI Aayog. “At that time, there were 700,000 sharecropper-lease farmers who were beneficiaries of a Crop Cultivator Right Card (CCRC). But in the new law, the government added a clause, under which the card made for the sharecropper must be signed by the farm owner and farmer. The farm owners were not ready to take the risk of the land, and the farmers kept moving away from it.”

“In 2022, we conducted a door-to-door survey among 3,885 farmers in 31 villages of nine districts of Andhra Pradesh, in which it came out that just 9.6% had the card, and the biggest reason was that the landowner did not sign. We found that only 6% of the landless sharecroppers are getting benefits under Rythu Bharosa, the cash support scheme of Andhra Pradesh. Telangana started this scheme LAC (loan eligibility card) after it was separated from Andhra Pradesh (2014) but stopped it after a year. This matter had also reached the court,” he further said.

National President of Rashtriya Kisan Mazdoor Mahasangh Shivkumar Kakka said, “Farming is a state subject. Many states have made laws for sharecroppers, but these have never been implemented on the ground.”

But predictions are useful for a country like India, where more than 50% of agricultural land is rain-fed and consequently, about 60% of rural livelihoods depend on monsoons.

Traditional weather forecasts tell us what is likely to happen within the next 24 hours and up to two weeks ahead, whereas climate prediction tells us what will likely happen in the coming seasons, years and decades. Both weather and climate forecasts are very important to develop adaption and mitigation strategies to maximise returns from agriculture and improve livelihoods.

If any of you have read the book Collapse by Jared Diamond, you will note that civilisations have failed over time due to the inability to look out on long enough time scales and to be adaptive to our environment.

Unknown unknowns

There is some clear evidence that shows the Earth has warmed since 1880 by at least 1.1° Celsius (1.9° Fahrenheit). The global mean rate for sea level rise was 1.7 mm per year between 1901 and 2010, as estimated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).

Shrinking ice sheets, declining arctic sea ice, glacial retreating and extreme weather events like high intensity rainfall and frequent droughts, all are visible and, to some extent, measurable with advances in satellite technologies. However, one tendency growing among many is that everything which is abnormal is attributed to global warming or climate change, without any concrete evidence.

Although our understanding of the weather pattern changes and climate change has expanded over the years, there are still many unknown unknowns that can influence the climate significantly.

Climate is influenced by many factors. Science and evidence about this gamut of factors is very limited as of today, despite the vast technological advancements in weather forecasting. With scientific advancement, improvements in satellite technologies, radar technologies, meteorological data collection, computation and simulation by using super computers, scientists are evolving new models by replacing old ones to enhance the accuracy of predictions. But still, we have miles to go.

One simple example of the status of data is that the existing database, even in the Western world, is insufficient to compute mean sea level trends with 100% accuracy, which is necessary to discuss the impact of global warming.

Recently, the director general of Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) mentioned that with the “unpredictable” nature of the monsoon, the latest forecasting models can only forecast weather with about 55-60% accuracy, although we strive for 100% accuracy levels.

Forecast accuracy is about 80% in a 24-hour period and about 60% over a five-day period. The accuracy of 24-hour forecasting has improved in the past several years from 40-50% to 80%. Even now, a 24-hour forecast is sometimes unable to capture a sudden change in the weather, which may occur within a matter of hours.

Also read: Why India Struggles to Predict the Weather Over Its Lands

While advances in satellite imagery and radio technology over the years have made short-term, 3-4 hour forecasts more accurate, the same may not hold true for 24-hour forecasts. However, one positive sign is that unlike stock market forecasts, accuracy levels in weather forecasting have been increasing over the years.

Better planning for climate adaptation and resilience

The persistent increase in unpredictable weather patterns, such as excess rains and temperatures, accompanied by frequent droughts in recent years, has led to a rise in uncertainty and risks to agricultural production across the globe.

A similar pattern is evident in India with excess rainfall being observed in Tamil Nadu (100%) and Telangana (90%), and deficit rainfall in Jharkhand (48%), Bihar (35%), West Bengal (25%) and Uttar Pradesh (40%) this year. These increasingly unpredictable weather patterns are adversely affecting the livelihoods of farmers, particularly small land-holders, who account for about 80% of Indian farmers.

Such a scenario calls for an urgent action plan focusing on not only the improvement of weather forecasting capabilities in the country, but also an enhancement of outreach efforts for the timely dissemination of crucial information to all farmers. This crucial information may also include, apart from timely and accurate weather forecasts, effective contingency plans for taking necessary actions to mitigate adverse impacts on crop production and the ecosystem.

In order to achieve this, measures must be to be taken to:

1. Enhance weather forecasting capabilities, both in terms of accuracy and timeliness, with technological advancement and innovation;

2. Establish a rapid response system for contingency plans to tackle adverse weather changes;

3. Enhance the agricultural extension system by equipping it with an efficient outreach mechanism utilising latest technologies, mobile apps and the like. This will ensure timely access to information for farmers, particularly small holders, so they can take necessary action.

Successful implementation of such a mechanism will facilitate the adoption of climate-smart and sustainable agricultural practices, which aid in improving the livelihoods of small farmers, thereby directly contributing to achieving sustainable development goals (SDGs) focusing on food security and poverty reduction.

To facilitate the successful planning and establishment of such a mechanism, a substantial amount of capital funding needs to be generated from both the private and public sectors.

Funding for such activities aimed at climate adaptation and resilience can be generated through the issuance of ‘green bonds’. Some private sector enterprises, such as Samunnati, have already started issuing such bonds for raising funds to put towards climate-smart agriculture.

In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Bureau of India’s (SEBI) latest initiative, inviting public comments on the consultation paper on green bonds, is a timely step in the right direction.

A number of initiatives have been taken up by various government and non-government entities in recent years. However, in order to be successful, such diverse initiatives need to be coordinated, consolidated, monitored and mentored, preferably by an independent authority. Further, the government may ensure their success by nudging such initiatives in the right direction with suitable regulatory and policy measures from time to time.

16, Jan 2023 | A Legal Researcher

Increasing forest cover has been advocated as one of the more important measures to deal with climate change related problems. To create carbon sinks, India is set to increase its forest cover from the current 25% to 33% of the total area and for this, different programmes have been initiated.[1] In Telangana, a flagship government programme called Telangana ku Haritha Haram (literally translates, this means ‘A green necklace for Telangana’) has been initiated.[2] One of the many impacts of this programme was that the farmers who were using the forest land for generations, in Bhadradri-Kothagudem district of Telanagana, were asked to give back the land to the government so that “forests can be grown”. This led to conflict between the formerly Podu (Slash and Burn agriculture) cultivators who are now settled in forest regions of the state and forest department.

Podu — a term that means ‘slash and burn mode of agriculture’ is now used to refer to all types of cultivation in the areas neighbouring the forest, and has been a recurrent issue in the region. While previously, some indigenous tribes used to engage in this practice of burning the forest, cultivating for a cycle and leaving the land, this practice actually ended long ago and people have settled down in their lands. The story of these Podu lands and the difficulties faced by the indigenous peoples in getting their land rights under the Forest Rights act, 2006 is something to be studied closely. This is one side of the story i.e., of the local forest dwelling people of the state. [3]

Among its four pillars of action, the land and livelihood rights of Adivasis and traditional forest dwellers, is one. CJP, with its expertise in navigating cases of human rights violations in the courts and beyond has been active on the issue; partnering with the All India Union of Forest Working Peoples (AIUFWP) since 2017 to battle any setback to these rights in the courts. This includes legally fighting back against malicious prosecution of leaders of the community and defending the Forest Rights Act, 2006 in the Supreme Court. We stand with the millions of Forest Dwellers and Adivasis whose lives and livelihoods are threatened. Please support our efforts by donating here.

Another story is that of migrants from, who have found themselves in one conflict after another. Gutti Koyas, a tribe originally living in Chhattisgarh (the tribe is known as Mura in Chhattisgarh)[i], had to escape the long-standing conflict that has ensued between Maoists and Salwa Judum- a counter insurgency militia consisting of tribal youth and backed by the Chhattisgarh government.[4] They migrated to the nearby forests of the then combined Andhra Pradesh and Odisha and as a result, a considerable population settled in what is now the Bhadradri-Kothagudem district of Telangana.

Naturally, these communities which migrated needed land for sustenance and they also depended on forest in terms of minor forest produce etc. However, since these are relatively new communities to come into the area, their occupation of land has always been viewed as “encroachment of the land” which has to be taken back. There have been conflicts between all Adivasis in that area and the forest department regarding the reclamation of land. Gutti Koyas, however, had a weaker claim to the Podu land compared to other tribes of the region and this fact, too has strengthened the view that “Guttikoyas are encroachers who are illegally living in the area”. Moreover, although they are considered as STs in Chhattisgarh, they do not enjoy the same protection in Telangana. According to Article 342 of the Indian Constitution, the President, after consultation with the Governor of the state, notifies the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in that particular state. Therefore, the list for Telangana and Chattisgarh would be different and thus, the Guttikoyas’ ST status in Chattisgarh does not translate into ST status in Telangana.

Recently, a forest range officer’s death in the district involving two Gutti Koyas as the accused has attracted much attention, giving the Gutti Koyas notoriety. The media’s sensational coverage of the officer’s death worked to further vilify the community. This resulted in a gram panchayat passing a resolution to “evict Gutti Koyas under its jurisdiction and sent back to Chhattisgarh” post the incident.

This (gram panchayat) resolution was termed as bad in law by the Telangana High Court since the Panchayat does not have the authority to evict the Gutti Koyas.[5] The government argued that the Gutti Koyas have become “habitual offenders and should be evicted”.

However, this is only a small respite for the community which is now facing an angry forest department, cautious politicians and a volatile future. There also have been demands from the Forest Department officers to grant them arms so that they can defend themselves. This demand is yet to materialise. According to officials, 30 acres of land has been “encroached upon” by Gutti Koyas in the Khammam district.

Why should Guttikoyas be Protected?

Essentially, even though Gutti Koyas are not STs under the Telangana law, they are vulnerable due to the special circumstances they are in. Neither can they go back to their state which they left some 20 years ago and nor can they find themselves a piece of land that will not be reclaimed by the forest officials. There were instances in which the Gutti Koyas were made to work for extremely low wages, so that their dependence on forest can be overlooked by the forest officials. Therefore, without the status of STs and without a place to call home, these Internally Displaced Persons (ISDPs) face violence, persecution and different forms of exploitation. And given that their displacement was a result of conflict- their trauma, and reasons to not go back to their state are huge. This calls for special protection of the community which is absent not in reality but also in discourse.

Different ways of solving the issues are being explored by the government but it does not seem like there is a consideration of Gutti Koyas as people who need to be protected. The death of the Forest Range officer has dominated the public discourse and opposition to Gutti Koyas living in the district has increased. It is therefore yet to be seen what decision the government will take on the repatriation of Gutti Koyas.

In 1996, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) created a first-of-its-kind calendar with district-wise weather information for crop cultivation.

It provided sowing and harvesting time, as well as weekly average rainfall and temperature during critical growth stages of the area's major crops.

Agriculture departments across the country used it to prescribe sowing dates to farmers. Over the years, the sowing schedule became India’s farming cycle, to the extent that at least two generations of farmers have now been following it.

However, rainfall patterns in the past two decades have seen substantial changes in the date of arrival, frequency as well as distribution. As a result, farmers who adhere to the crop calendar often face crop loss.

Sethpal Singh of Nandi village in Uttar Pradesh’s Saharanpur district has been in such a situation four times in the past decade.

“I always start preparing paddy nurseries by the second week of June. Twenty days later I transplant them. This is also the schedule that officials at the local Krishi Vigyan Kendra tell us to follow,” Singh, who owns over 12 hectares (ha), said.

“But if it does not rain in these 20 days, the saplings go to waste and we have to prepare them again. This is what happened this year too,” he added.

This year, Saharanpur received no rain in the first two weeks of June, seven per cent less than normal rain in the third week, and no rain in the fourth week, according to IMD data.

The district also saw 11 per cent and 52 per cent less than normal rainfall in the first two weeks of July.

All the farmers Down To Earth (DTE) spoke to in Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Bihar narrate similar stories.

“At least three of the past 10 years have seen a significant delay in rainfall. In all those years, I had halved my acreage under paddy to cut my losses,” Swaroop Prasad, a farmer from Madhya Pradesh’s Rewa district, said.

Santanu Bal, principal scientist with the Indian Council of Agri-cultural Research (ICAR)-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA), told DTE that the existing calendar would not help in decision-making for crop production in the backdrop of current climate variability.

“The crop calendar was set according to the onset of rain, its volume and distribution. For example, the monsoon reaches the Kerala coast by June 1. Crop sowing in the state has been set accordingly. It reaches Odisha by June 12-13, where, again, sowing has been set as per this date. Agriculture universities in the states developed the calendar according to the major crops and the monsoon,” Bal explained.

But the calendar is based on the assumption that the weather is “normal” and can no longer precisely suggest operations for rain-fed agriculture, he added.

DTE analysed IMD data for 30 years, from 1988 to 2018, covering 676 of India’s 730 districts in 28 states and the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir, to find that 420 districts in the country (62 per cent of the districts covered in the data) have seen a decrease in rainfall in June — the key month for sowing the kharif crop.

A total of 210 districts (31 per cent of the districts covered in the data) also reported an increase in the number of days with no rainfall.

Though 248 districts (36 per cent of the districts covered in the data) saw an increase in rainfall, it does not really help farmers because it still means unpredictable rainfall. For instance, a district could see heavy rain one day and then no rain for a long duration.

Growing a crop like paddy, which needs continuous flooding of fields up to 10 cm depth for two weeks at the transplantation stage, requires precise weather information.

Overall, 55 per cent of India’s net sown area (139.42 million ha) is rain-dependent and grows 34 of the country’s 40-odd major crops, according to a July 2022 draft policy paper of the National Rainfed Area Autho-rity (NRRA).

This signifies the pressing need for a relook at the crop weather calendar, which NRRA also states in the paper: “Long-term data for India indicates, that rainfed areas experience 3 to 4 drought years per decade. Of these, two to three are moderate and one or two are severe in intensity. Rain-fed crops are likely to be worst hit due to limited options of coping with variability of rainfall and temperature resulting in a shift in sowing time and shorter growing season, which may necessitate effective adjustment in sowing and harvesting dates. Increasing intra-seasonal variability of rainfall has become a major concern.”

False start

Bal highlighted another phenomenon, called “false start”, happening more frequently in the first monsoon month of June.

It refers to a situation where the first spell of rain is followed by dry spell lasting a week or more.

“June has been troubling. There is not much difference in the onset of rain but the major concern is the break in rain once you have sown. A break in monsoon has been happening more in June. For rain-fed areas, there is no other option because the sowing window is only till July 10-15,” Bal said.

“False start condition is very vital, because it leads to germination failure and re-sowing by farmers resulting in increased cost of culti-vation,” stated a paper published in Agricultural and Forest Meteorology journal on March 14, 2022.

Adapting to the changed rain pattern, farmers already have started to delay sowing.

Bharat Dighole, a Nashik-based farmer and president of the Maharashtra State Onion Grower’s Association, said many farmers had skipped sowing in June.

“Cotton, soybean, bajra (pearl millet) and corn are among the major kharif crops grown in the region. For the past five years, we are not sowing in June due to high risks that come with uncertain rains. The farmers understand that the timing is not optimal for the crops and voluntarily push the sowing to July. June sowing in Nashik is only about 5 per cent; the majority of the sowing happens in July,” Dighole said.

Farmers in Nandi village too have shifted their kharif crops to July-August to minimise losses due to a failed June and a weak July monsoon.

“Apart from paddy, our other major crops are moong (green gram) and urad (black gram) in pulses and mustard and sesame in oilseeds, which are sown and harvested between March and June. But their season has shifted by two months to July-August since the last four years. We have seen a positive yield because of this,” Vinod Kumar, a farmer from Nandi, said.

Singh remembered that in 2021, there was heavy rainfall during the months of March and April that affected the short-duration zaid crops that are sown in March and harvested by May.

This turned into a vicious cycle. Zaid got prolonged till the kharif sowing season which led to delay in sowing and harvesting of kharif and, in turn, delayed clearing of the land for the rabi crop of wheat.

Farmers from other villages have also reported skipping the crop season. “I sow sesame and paddy in kharif every year in June. Since it did not rain, I could not sow these crops. Had I sown late, my rabi pea crop, which is my main source of income, would have been delayed,” Ajit Pratap of Jalaun district, Uttar Pradesh, said.

Kharif lag

As of August 12, 2022, kharif sowing lags by 3.76 million ha (mha) compared to the corresponding period in 2021, according to data on the website of the Union Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare.

Area under paddy—the main kharif crop—is short by 4.38 mha (12 per cent), compared to the 2021 data. The gap between “normal” paddy sown (calculated as an average of sown area between 2017-18 to 2021-22 during the corresponding week) during this time and the current sowing is much more at 21.9 per cent. The “normal” sown area for this time of the season is 39.7 mha.

This coincides with a deficit in rainfall in important paddy growing states of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand and West Bengal. June had ended with a rain deficit of 8 per cent, with 18 states staring at a “large rainfall” deficit.

DTE analysed area under paddy till the second week of July in the last 10 years and found that there are fluctuations almost every year. In six of the 10 years, the area decreased when compared to the previous year’s figure during the same period.

‘Normal’ revised

IMD has taken note of the erratic nature of the monsoon. In April this year, it lowered the average normal value for June-September by 12 mm. The new normal of 868.6 mm is based on 1971-2020 data and replaces the earlier figure of 880.6 mm based on 1961-2010 data. This is reason enough for a re-look into the conventional sowing dates and practices followed across India.

In July 2020, Bal and other ICAR-CRIDA scientists started creating a dynamic crop weather calendar for 10 crops in 25 locations across the country. “The existing crop calendar is static. In the dynamic one, when you change an input — for instance, the monsoon arrival date or the average temperature in a particular month—the sowing and harvesting dates are optimised accordingly,” Bal said.

Nabansu Chattopadhyay, a former deputy director general of the agricultural meteorology division of IMD, is of the view that IMD’s rain data and its translation for use to meet agricultural needs are two different things.

“Land warming takes away the moisture from the soil, and heavy or excess rainfall does not allow it to retain the lost moisture because the soil does not get enough time to absorb it. Such scenarios occur when there are long breaks between the rain spells during monsoon,” he said.

Determining the onset of the crop growing season using this “soil-water balance” approach is important because it takes into account the amount of rainfall needed to build up the soil moisture and loss of soil moisture through evapotrans-piration. A dry spell of over two weeks after sowing could lead to crop failure or yield reduction because topsoil dries out.

New indices

ICAR scientists have tried to see the length and impact of a dry spell and have defined a new index called the dry spell index (DSI) in a paper published in the journal Agricultural and Forest Meteorology in December 2021. The index can be used to recommend area-specific crops based on new rain patterns.

The research finds that DSI is better in quantifying the reduction in yield due to a dry spell, as compared to the Standardised Precipitation Index (SPI), widely used by government agencies to monitor soil moisture levels. It takes into account the cumulative seasonal rainfall, not the length and impact of dry spells.

The paper quantifies the cumulative impact of dry spells during the kharif season on six major rain-fed crops in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana and Andhra Pradesh in 2012-16.

The analysis showed that the impact of dry spells on yields was higher in comparison to total rainfall indicated by the Standardised Precipitation Index. The productivity of all the crops was significantly influenced by DSI in over 65 per cent growing regions.

“The information on continuance of dry spells in a season is vital in deciding a particular crop or crop variety, and to breed varieties of various crop durations for a specific location and deciding adaptation strategies, supplementary irrigation and field operations in agriculture,” the paper said.

Granular assessment

Climate change should be integrated into crop calendars at the hyper local level, Abinash Mohanty, programme lead in the risks and adaptation team at Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), a non-profit in Delhi, said.

“We cannot have a straight cut fit for the whole of India because the monsoonal pattern is not the same or uniform across Indian districts,” he said, adding that the risk assessment and contingency plan also need to be synchronised.

“CEEW has been studying extreme weather events at the district level. We have conducted a granular risk assessment for the past 50 years and found that 75 per cent of the districts show a swapping trend, which means that the traditional flood prone areas are becoming drought areas and vice versa,” Mohanty said.

Contingency plans

Ideally, district-wise contingency plans for agriculture should be put into action depending on the rainfall deficit. In 2010, ICAR-CRIDA prepared a contingency plan for all the districts.

The plan includes information about the district’s agro-ecological zone; rainfall, irrigation and land use patterns; crops cultivated and the sowing window, among others. It also lists the kinds of emergencies the district is prone to and strategies to counter them.

For example, in Uttar Pradesh’s Aligarh district, which has received 52 per cent deficit rainfall between June 1 and August 19, the contingency plan advises farmers to plant early-maturing varieties of pearl millet such as Composite-ICTP-8203 and Raj-171 Hybrid-Pusa-23 and 322. It recommends cultivating moong bean varieties like Samraaat and Meha and sorghum varieties like Composite-CSV-13, CSV-15 and Vijeta Hybrid-CSH-16 and CSH-14.

The contingency plan for Bihar’s Aurangabad district, which has faced 47 per cent deficit rain between June 1 and August 19, recommends replacing normal crop varieties to early-growing varieties of traditional crops like rice, wheat, pigeon pea, lentils and chickpea.

However, in a July-end meeting between the Union agriculture secretary and officials of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and West Bengal, which had seen deficit rainfall by then, the officials said the states were not in a position to implement contingency plans because seeds of alternative crops were not available, a government official on condition of anonymity, said.

“They said that they do not keep a reserve of seeds in such large quantities. What will they do of those seeds if monsoon was normal,” the official said.

Still, contingency planning and adapting to changing climate could be a possible solution, V K Singh, director at ICAR-CRIDA, said. “We have identified 650 districts across India that are vulnerable to climate change. An updated plan for over 350 is already in place. Farmers need to adapt by culti-vating drought-resilient varieties of crops. They could diversify by choosing horticulture and growing grains,” he noted.

States want an update

Some states have recognised the need to align their cropping cycles with the erratic nature of the monsoon. Assam has requested ICAR-CRIDA to do a revision of the crop calendar of the whole state. Following this, ICAR formed a committee under Bal to look at the change in rainfall and temperature in the state and to work on the best way to revise the calendar.

In Bihar too, the state government, in its Climate Resilient Agriculture Plan formed in September 2019, talks about an “improved climate resilient variety which is suitable for the cropping system and crop calendar”.

Scientists also make a case for reclassifying agro-climatic zones that have been in use since 1979, when imd had first identified them to develop location-specific strate-gies for agricultural development in the country. “Agriculture needs re-oriention. There is a need to reclassify agro-climatic zones,” Chattopadhyay said.

Chhatopadhyay and three scientists from IMD-Delhi, IMD-Pune, and the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, documented this in a paper published in the journal Current Science in 2019.

The paper observed significant changing trends in weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, heavy rainfall and rainy days at various agro-climatic zones in the northeastern states, Gujarat, hilly areas of the country, and central and peninsular India.

“This definitely indicates change in climate from pre-90 to post-90s,” the paper stated, and added that the climate change may be reflected in the agro-climatic zones as well and ultimately affect the criteria of their classification based on climatic parameters.

It argued that any change in climatic parameters, particularly temperature and rain, in the agro-climatic zones will have a significant bearing on the existing agro-climatic classification as well as on crop production.

IMD agrees

For the first time, IMD also has recognised the need to revise the crop weather calendar. “Studies suggest that variability is incre-asing in certain areas. It is leading to more floods and more droughts. There is a change in the distribution of rainfall and we are finding the frequency of high rainfall events increasing due to climate change,” Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, director general of meteorology, IMD, said.

After ICAR-CRIDA prepared dynamic crop calendars for 25 districts, IMD has asked the organisation to prepare a dynamic crop weather calendar for all districts in the country, Mohapatra said. The work has been completed for 75 districts as of now, he added.

Studies also say that when farmers are able to access better advisories, changing sowing dates is one of the most beneficial climate change adaptation measures for them.

A four-year intervention study on 11,250 farmers in 75 villages of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Madhya Pradesh said that 43 per cent of the respondents found change of sowing dates as the most useful impact from efficient advisory services.

In the four years of the project, the farmers were able to access climate resilient agricultural technologies and best practices. The project was undertaken by the US Agency for International Development-India along with CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, Agriculture and Food Security (CCAFS) to scale out resilient agricultural interventions.

For now, the dynamic crop weather calendar is running in a project mode and has helped farmers, Bal claimed. But there is a dire need to extend it to all the districts for all the crops in the forms of more effective advisories.

BK Jha from Damera village, Telangana reports

Nearly two kilometres from Damera village in the Hanamkoda district in Telangana, 20 cotton growers were gathered to take stock of the current status of their blossoming cotton in their fields. Ganga, Batthi Reddy, Kumar Swamy, Madaram Kankiya, Dikshapal, Yogeshwaran, Mohan Rao, Ravindra Reddy, and D Chinnapedi were marginal farmers with one to eight-acre land where they grow cotton. Thanks to Bt-1 and 2, their yield has increased significantly and they were getting a reasonable price (above than minimum support price) in the market. But their main pain point now is pests, especially pink bollworm (PBW) which is an insect known for being a devastating pest in cotton farming. Cotton growers here are trying hard to overcome the challenge.

Small farmers, with 14 to 30-acre cotton fields, came from nearby Narmeta village located in the neighbouring Jangaon district. From Narmeta, educated cotton grower Velangal Reddy with 30 acres of land was equally concerned about the attack of pink bollworm. His fellow villagers G Bala Subha Reddy and D Chimapeddi with 14-acre cotton fields each recalled the previous years when their fields were heavily attacked by pink bollworms and they were helpless and did not know to prevent their crops from PBW. A visit to the cotton fields of Telangana explains not only the main points of the growers but also the interventions that are giving positive outcomes in terms of preventing the loss due to pest attacks.

Agricultural fields in areas surrounding Damera and other villages in the Hanamkonda and Jangaon districts in the Warangal region of Telangana were blossoming with cotton crops and growers feel that this season would fetch them a better price with enhanced yield compared to previous years. Pest threats to cotton crops were minimised by the intervention of Project Jagruthi, launched by Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) – a French Company working in the agriculture and food sectors.

It is nearly two decades now since Bt Cotton was introduced in India. It is claimed that it transformed the ways India does its cotton farming. Cotton growers of Damera and Narmeta say that they are still facing pest breaks like bollworm. Interventions of LDC, with awareness workshops and distribution of pheromone trappers, have helped them a lot but there is certainly a need for new technology for cotton seeds.

Velangal Reddy, an educated cotton grower from Nermeta village who cultivates cotton on his 30 acres, looked very disappointed with the way India deals with GM technologies. He says, “We are using all GM edible oils and other things, imported from outside, but here in India there is a strong lobby against it. We are not only facing pink bollworm but labour shortage also due to the government welfare schemes. The younger generation is ready to work outside but not in the fields even though they have 30 acres of land. The government should provide newer technologies to us as par with the US and other developed countries. If we can use Bt cotton oil, then what is the harm of using other GM crops and products? LDC’s Project Jagruthi has helped us a lot in terms of prevention against pink bollworm, but the point is we need newer technologies in seeds.”

Pink bollworm is now the main concern and it causes huge damage to the cotton crop across India. Following the pink bollworm outbreak in 2021, LDC launched ‘Project Jagruthi‘ for cotton growers in India.

“We have trained over 7,500 farmers in over 30 villages in Punjab, Haryana, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh through workshops. In addition, we provided over 40,000 pheromone traps to the farmers so far. In northern states, we have distributed 17,000 traps whereas in Central and South India including Telangana 23,000 traps have been given to cotton growers. We aim to further increase this in the next season. In Damera, we organised an awareness camp and distributed eight traps per acre. Nearly 250 farmers benefitted under the project and as awareness and yield increased, cotton growers of 17 villages in the region now come forward for traps. They are even requesting LDC to impress upon agents in the market to provide them with the traps and they are ready to buy it,” says Sumeet Mittal, Cotton Platform Head-India, LDC.

Dikshapal, a marginal cotton farmer (4 acres) in Damera village and one of the 250 beneficiaries of Project Jagruthi, was in an upbeat mood as his yield increased with the use of a pheromone trap in the field. “In the 2021 season, with the pink bollworm attack, I was able to get only five quintals per acre of cotton. This year I am expecting over eight quintals of cotton which is a significant increase,” he says. Similarly Mohan Rao, Ravindra Reddy, Yogeshwaran and other fellow villagers got a 30-40 per cent increase in the yield. Reddy is also expecting nine quintals of cotton per acre. Last year, the yield was limited to about six quintals per acre due to the pink bollworm menace which gives cotton growers nightmares.

It was admitted by the cotton growers of Telangana that awareness and pheromone traps have significantly increased per acre yield. Mergu Rajkumaraya, who has been cultivating cotton for nearly 20 years, says the cost of cultivation is increasing due to rising pesticide, fertiliser and labour costs, which are exacerbated by pink bollworm.

Each cotton-growing state such as Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Punjab, and Karnataka is by and large has been affected by pink bollworm which affected the yield in Gujarat hugely in 2014. “In Telangana, we witness the menace in the 2016-17 season. Pink bollworm damages the crop by 5 per cent if it attacks late but at an early stage, attack damage can be 30-40 per cent. There are three stages of pink bollworm- Lieur, Mouths and the final stage is known as a worm which causes the loss. With pheromone traps, we try to stop the mating of male and female mouths. Another advantage of the trap is that it gives an indication and severity of pink bollworm attack, accordingly, we can plan the quantum of pesticides to be used in the field,” explains Gangadhara S, Senior Manager- Research, LDC.

Gangadhara says that mass trapping is an effective solution to overcome the challenge of the pest attack and for this, all growers need pheromone traps. “Along with awareness workshops, LDC is making all efforts to distribute a large number of traps so that they reach the maximum number of cotton growers in Telangana,” he adds.

Is prevention with a pheromone trap the only solution? To prevent massive loss due to pest attacks, Bt Cotton seed companies give some non-Bt seeds to the growers to be used in the field. Due to a lack of awareness about its efficacy and being yield conscious farmers usually do not use non-Bt seeds, hence sometimes, early identification of pink bollworm is delayed.

Along with prevention, other experiments are on. High-Density Planting System (HDPS) in cotton has been showing positive outcomes in experimental stages. HDPS is being done extensively at Professor Jayshankar Telangana State Agriculture University (PJTSAU), Hyderabad.

Dr B Anil Kumar, Senior Scientist, PJTSAU, takes care of 11 districts of Telangana with training and awareness camps. He moves from village to village on daily basis to train farmers with the best practices.

“In a conventional method, we sow 5,500 plants in the given 120 cm space and a gap of 60 cm in black soil. Similarly, in red soil, we sow 14,500 plants in a 90X30 space. But in HDPS, 25,000 plants are placed in a 90X20 formula. We have seen a significant increase in yield from nine quintals per acre to 15 quintals per acre. It is very effective in red soil,” says Dr Kumar.

On pink bollworm, he says since the last five years Telangana has been witnessing its menace and it damages the quality of crops. “The state government has been providing subsidies of Rs 4,000 per acre to farmers and equipping them with new technologies. For example, we are providing pneumatic planters to cotton growers. With this plant a farmer can sow one acre with HDPS in half-hour,” informs Dr Anil Kumar who strongly recommends crop rotation (maize in January) for Telangana farmers to overcome the pain points like pink bollworm. According to him, in Telangana with three agro-climatic zones, cotton season begins with the first round of sowing in May and by December season gets over.

In nutshell, till India gets other advanced tech-enabled pest-resistant seeds, only prevention and smart farming can help cotton farmers of Telangana. LDC has shown them the way and they need to follow the training tips and fetch pheromone traps from markets if the company is not able to cover all the farmers of the state.

HYDERABAD: At a time when climate change has impacted agricultural output across the world, decoding soil health has gained prominence and importance. Many say that it has become as important for agriculture as medical science is for human beings. However, despite its overarching need, the government has been unable to make them available for tillers across the country. To address this, a startup, Krishitantra, has developed ‘Krishi- RASTAA (rapid automated soil testing agronomy advisory) — a portable and automated soil analysis system that has been designed to provide rapid results of soil nutrients with customised agronomy within 40 minutes.

All that the farmer or technician needs to do is to collect a soil sample and pass it through the chemicals, which are placed in the machine. The parameters are automatically sent to a mobile application with all the input data to test macronutrients — such as nitrogen, phosphorous, potassium, electrical conductivity and pH level — micronutrients — such as sulphur, boron, zinc, iron, copper and organic carbon — and microbes like MB carbon (MBC) in the soil sample.

The information, when passed to the Krishitantra mobile application, gets analysed automatically based on the inputs. Through cloud services and API integration, the farmer or technician gets the soil test report within 40 minutes on the app. The values of the 11 parameters with ideal range and nutrient recommendations are given in the soil test report, which can be used for as many as 100 types of crops, for which the nutrient and fertiliser recommendations are instantly provided.

The test reports can be shared via WhatsApp and SMS, while a physical copy of the report can also be printed out. As of now, the reports are available in English, Hindi, Telugu and Kannada, while work is going on to add more languages in the near future.

The machine can be operated by anyone, who knows how to operate a cell phone and can follow the procedure to do the testing. In a single test, a sample of the soil from a four-acre land can be tested. However, since each machine costs about `1.2 lakh, it can be used by Farmer Producer Organisations (FPO), progressive farmers and also by dealers of fertilisers who can recommend the right amount of fertilisers to the farmers, Krishna, a representative of Krishitantra, tells TNIE.

“It has the potential to create a new livelihood opportunity for educated youth who can purchase this machine and do soil testing analysis as technicians on a custom hiring basis for farmers,” he adds.The machine and the application were developed with the support of Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU), Indian Institute of Rice Research (IIRR), NABARD and other partners. Krishitantra has won the ‘emerging agri innovators award’ at the FICCI Agri Startup Awards 2021, and also was the winner of ‘the most promising IoT Startup-Scalability category’ at the IOTMATRIX 2020 Awards.

Hyderabad: Turmeric, spices, chilli and cotton and a few varieties of rice grown in Telangana have come in for praise from Union Minister of Commerce and Industry Piyush Goyal, who also mentioned the unique Cheriyal paintings from the State.

Participating in an interaction on `Enhancing global opportunities for Indian Manufacturers’, organised by industry body Federation of Telangana Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FTCCI) here on Friday, he said that the trade community should focus on quality to tap the international opportunities.

The exports last year were $ 675 billion and till September this year the growth in exports has been 17%. The exports this year are likely to touch $750 billion, he said.

Even as he referred to Hyderabad as the `land of Covid vaccine’, Goyal said Hyderabad still continues to have influence of what he called the Mughal culture and colonial hangover. He chose to avoid mentioning Charminar while referring to Hyderabad as the `land of Bhagyalakshmi Temple’. He also used the trade platform to pitch a `double engine sarkar’ for Telangana.

Goyal asked the cotton industry stakeholders to discuss a strategy to ensure traceability of cotton and better value of cotton products. On concerns raised by the rice growers over recognising non-basmati rice varieties, he said the Centre has imposed export restrictions to ensure food security domestically.

About 90 lakh tonne food grains per month were needed for distribution under the public distribution system. The food grain production was likely to be affected due to the untimely rains in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh, he said.

FTCCI President Anil Agarwal flagged the challenges faced by the micro, small, and medium enterprises. The ease of doing ranking should be outcome- based and not merely on implementation of reforms. The trade has seen supply chain disruptions. The Government’s focus should be on increasing the contribution from the manufacturing segment to the GDP.

The industry body also flagged antidumping duty, levy on export of non-basmati rice, rationalization of GST in certain pharma segments, making it mandatory for the companies getting the production linked incentives to source from small players and others.

However, the environmental impact of large-scale oil palm cultivation in these geographies is of concern, globally as the regions continue to be associated with deforestation and peatland destruction for oil palm cultivation.
Overall, the state wants to expand oil palm plantations to 22 times the current land under oil palm.
It will continue until the palm oil trees start bearing fruit,” says Pratap Kumar Reddy, another palm oil farmer from the Thirumalagiri village of Suryapet district.","The Telangana government has planned to bring a total of 8,09,371 hectares of land in the state under oil palm cultivation in the next four years.

This is a 22-fold increase in area from the existing 36,421 hectares of land under palm oil cultivation.

The state government supports farmers from farm to market, thus, assuring income with palm oil plantation.

However, the inclination toward palm oil cultivation comes with many challenges such as low benefit for small and marginal farmers, dependence on groundwater and long gestation period. Globally too there are concerns about the environmental impacts of oil palm monoculture.

This is the first article in a two-part series on oil palm cultivation in Telangana. Part Two discusses the state’s shift from traditional crops to water intensive crops such as paddy and oil palm and their potential impacts on the environment.

On a cool, mid-November evening, Vidya Sagar, a 56-year-old farmer, was rushing from one corner of his 3.2-hectare oil palm field to another, hurriedly gathering fresh fruit from the trees before the sun sets. Sagar is a resident of Khammam district’s Medepally village in the state of Telangana. He plans to expand the oil palm plantation on the remaining 1.2 hectares of his land, given that the government is incentivising the crop.

“There is no reason to think otherwise,” he says, listing many benefits the state government offers for oil palm cultivation: an assured procurement of all his produce, free electricity which makes irrigation cost-free and subsidised seedlings provided by oil processing firms.

“Oil palm (from which palm oil is derived) cultivation has proved very profitable for the farmers for several reasons. First, there is huge government support to grow the crop. There is little risk of monkey and wild boar attacks on these crops. Oil palm trees can withstand harsh weather conditions, and there is far less labour involved in growing them,” Sagar tells Mongabay-India while working on his oil palm field.

Another farmer, 62-year-old Hariprasad S. from the same village, adds to the ongoing conversation. He has converted four hectares of his mango farm to an oil palm farm. The reason, he says, was the assured procurement of all his produce by these oil processing firms.

He shows his diary in which he has written the rates at which he sold his fresh fruit at the nearby Sathupally oil processing unit in Khammam, over the last one year. The best price he got in the last six months was around Rs. 13,000 per tonne. Usually, he is able to pick and sell oil palm fruits about twice a month. He claims that if these rates continue, he could earn around Rs. 3.32 lakh (Rs. 332,000) annually, from each acre (o.4 hectares), which would mean an annual income of almost Rs. 33.2 lakh (Rs. 3.32 million) from his four-hectare land.

In Medepally village, where Sagar and Hariprasad are from, at least a dozen farmers are into oil palm farming. Many of them opted for cultivating this crop, more than 30 years ago. Vidya Sagar is one among them.

“Currently, there are 23,000 farmers in Telangana who are into oil palm cultivation. We have around 36,421 hectares under oil palm cultivation, out of which 16,187 hectares are fruit-bearing fields,” informed an official from the state horticulture department, requesting anonymity.

Telangana’s oil palm farmers see their fortune growing with the country’s increasing consumption of palm oil, which is derived from the oil palm fruit.

Palm oil is a widespread component of products in the Indian market – from daily use products like soaps and toothpastes to edible products like biscuits, cooking oil, chocolates and more. Globally though, the use of palm oil is controversial as the supply chain is usually riddled with environmental issues.

India consumes more than nine million metric tonnes of palm oil annually and its edible oil import bills are in trillions of rupees. India is the world’s largest importer of palm oil. It needs to import this oil to meet the gap of 61.80 percent between the total domestic demand and the local production.

India and other palm oil consuming countries depend heavily on producer countries in Southeast Asia, such as Indonesia and Malaysia for imports. However, the environmental impact of large-scale oil palm cultivation in these geographies is of concern, globally as the regions continue to be associated with deforestation and peatland destruction for oil palm cultivation.

To ease the burden of the treasury and lower the dependence on imports, the union government is on a mission to expand the cultivation of oil palm across the country under its ambitious National Mission on Edible Oils-Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) programme. It aims to increase the area of oil palm to 10 lakh (one million) hectares by 2025-26, up from 3.5 lakh (350,000) hectares in 2019-20. Telangana sees a share for itself in this pie.

Telangana’s ambitious plans

Oil palm plantation is not new to the southern Indian state of Telangana, second after Andhra Pradesh in crude palm oil production. It started in the early 1990s when some farmers in districts like Khammam started growing it with seeds imported from other countries. The state now has around 36,421 hectares of land under oil palm plantation.

In 2021-22, the state produced 46,171 MT (Metric Tons) of crude palm oil. Most of these oil palm plantations are confined to four districts of the state – Khammam, Bhadradri Kothagudem, Suryapet, and Nalgonda. However, the state government has decided to go big on oil palm farming, beyond the target given by the union government.

A senior official from the state horticulture department told Mongabay-India that the union government had given the target of growing oil palm over 1,21,405 hectares in the state in the next four years. But the state has decided to bring 8,09,371 hectares of the state land under palm oil cultivation in the same period. The plan is also to expand its plantation in 27 out of a total of 33 districts of the states. Six districts that face water crises and urban areas in the state are not part of this plan. Overall, the state wants to expand oil palm plantations to 22 times the current land under oil palm.

In the latest annual state budget, presented by state finance minister T. Harish Rao in March, the government announced a Rs. one billion budgetary allocation for covering an additional 1,01,171 hectares of land under oil palm cultivation in the current financial year 2022-23. Data suggests that the government anticipates investing a total of Rs. 72 billion between 2022-23 and 2026-27 to boost palm oil production in the state.

Reaping the benefits

Samnini Nageswar Rao is another farmer from Medepally village of Khammam district. He explained how much he invests in oil palm maintenance annually. As electricity in Telangana is free for farmers, there is no cost involved in irrigating their land with motor pumps. In each acre of land, there are around 56 oil palm trees. They need anywhere between Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 22,000, which includes the cost of fertiliser, manure, and others annually, whereas the annual profits they get is around Rs. three lakh (Rs. 300,000) per annum for each acre (0.4 hectares).

The state government supports the farmers opting for oil palm plantation in their fields. “In palm oil, we get subsidies for drip irrigation equipment, fertiliser and intercropping for the initial four years. I have planted groundnut as an intercrop in the space left between oil palm trees, to make profits from the farmland. It will continue until the palm oil trees start bearing fruit,” says Pratap Kumar Reddy, another palm oil farmer from the Thirumalagiri village of Suryapet district. He recently switched to oil palm farming from cotton farming. All these subsidies, however, cease to exist after four years when the palm trees start bearing fruits, he complains.

Free electricity and irrigation matter as most farmers use groundwater for oil palm cultivation in the state. Most of the farmers Mongabay-India met in Khammam, Kodad and Suryapet districts claim that they use water from wells and borewells to cultivate oil palm. Each mature oil palm tree requires around 200-250 litres of water per tree.

Besides the relief in irrigation, the farmers get support for other purposes. For example, oil-producing companies in the state have their nurseries where they grow saplings and provide them to farmers at subsidised rates. In Telangana, the number of oil-producing companies has increased from three to eleven in the last five years. They have 30 nurseries in the state now, the highest in the country, as claimed by the state horticulture department.

One of the key attractions of oil palm farming is the buyback guarantee that these oil companies provide. It has lured many farmers to shift to palm oil, farmers admitted during the conversation with Mongabay-India.

These farmers are confident about the price as it is decided by the state horticulture department, depending on the international market. It is also a prerequisite for the department to establish factories in each district before it is taken up for palm oil plantation.

Through the National Mission on Edible Oils – Oil Palm (NMEO-OP) scheme, Telangana government gives incentives to farmers to grow intercrops like pulses, groundnut, and other crops for four years of new palm oil gardens during this transition period to compensate for the losses due to the shift. These include an 80 percent subsidy to start drip irrigation in palm oil gardens, the government bearing the majority of the cost of palm oil plant material, and assistance of Rs 10,500/hectare annually for intercropping, among others. The government plans to give “subsidies of Rs 26000, Rs 5000, and Rs 5000 per acre in the first, second and third year of palm plantation.”

Experts find the decision to expand palm oil farming beneficial for the farmers. I.V. Srinivas Reddy, an associate professor at Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University, has researched palm oil production. He told Mongabay-India that oil palm plantation has some added benefits too. He claimed that studies have shown that it has good carbon sequestration tendencies, while the by-product of oil palm could also be used in mulching activities.

“First of all, oil palm uses four times less water than crops like paddy and sugarcane. There are other benefits, too, with palm oils. It has helped farmers increase their incomes and reduce agriculture-related drudgeries and risks of crop failure and pest attacks. As these are long period crops which are grown up to 25 years to 30 years, this assures a sustainable income for the farmers,” he said.

Cultivation concerns

While there is a rosy picture painted at one end, at the other, there are challenges in oil palm cultivation. Many farmers said there is nothing for small and marginal farmers in this business. Hariprasad, the farmer from Medepally, admits that most oil palm farming is confined to big farmers in the state who can devote more than two hectares of their land to oil palm plantations. The farmers with small landholdings seldom take up this plantation, he adds. This is because there is no productivity in the initial four years from the land. These plants have long gestation periods, and the fruits are born only after four years.

The second issue with increasing oil palm cultivation is the water requirement. Most farmers are using groundwater for irrigation. If a farmer doesn’t have a borewell facility, oil palm cultivation is not easy.

Puspawati Shirarao, a farmer in Kodad in Khammam district, for example, uses canal water from one of the water reservoirs from Kodad. During summers, especially in May, the low water availability leads to less production of fruits, she shares. She says intercropping can be done in oil palm fields primarily in the new ones, up to the initial four years. “After four years, when the palm oil trees grow bigger, their strong roots expand underground, and the soil fertility in the free areas in the farm gets affected. So, it is tough to grow any other crop in these aged gardens,” she tells Mongabay-India.

Some experts say that the ambitious scale of expansion of oil palm cultivation in the state may not be economically viable. Ramanjaneyulu G.V., an agricultural scientist at the Hyderabad-based Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, told Mongabay-India that the impulsive decision of the state government to expand oil palm cultivation in the state could create new problems. “Till now, the state government is giving much thrust to a particular crop. The bumper subsidies and government support have forced many farmers to shift to this plantation. But what will happen if this support ceases to exist in the future? This comes at a time when the state is now importing vegetables and other traditionally produced crops in this state. This could not be an economically viable option for the farmers and the agriculture sector at large,” he said.

Scientists from across the nation stressed the need to encourage and grow ‘resilient’ plant varieties for dryland agriculture and address the distress among farmers.

Focus was also on the importance of shifting crops to reduce the cost for farmers at the three-day international conference on “Reimagining Rain-fed Agro-ecosystems: Challenges and Opportunities” that started at ICAR - Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture (CRIDA) here on Thursday.

Chancellor of Rani Lakshmi Bai Central Agricultural University, Jhansi, Panjab Singh was the chief guest. He called upon scientists to develop these resilient to climate change varieties that would consume less water and increase production.

“CRIDA’s contribution in improving dryland agriculture is immense. This is a rare institute. Not only India, other countries have also benefited from it,” he said.

“The growth of our country is dependent on our focus on dryland farming. About 50% of land is dry and compared to irrigated areas, dry land has more potential for faster agriculture growth,” he said, adding that there was a need to shift and increase productivity. He also laid emphasis on technology transfer to farmers.

Karimnagar: Agriculture is one of the few sectors which have been exposed to rapid change by utilising modern technology. The mechanisation of the agriculture sector is fast-paced.

Though a variety of equipment has been introduced to ease the cultivation process in the wake of a shortfall of farm labourers, another gadget ‘drone’ has been added to the sector now.

For instance, drones will be used to spray pesticides. As part of its plans, the Prof Jayashankar Agriculture University has decided to train farmers in drone operation, for which the university is likely to set up a ‘drone academy’.

After completion of the training, licences would be issued to farmers with the designation of ‘drone operator’ so that the trained farmers could spray pesticides on crops.

Besides mixing the quantity of water with pesticides, farmers would also be trained in carrying out spraying without causing any harm to animals, birds and the environment, agriculture scientists said.

Though the procedure of the training programme has not yet been finalised, the training would be imparted through the Krishi Vigyan Kendras.

Since agriculture scientists are not experts in drone operation, they have asked manufacturing companies, which would supply drones to the government, to train the farmers, apart from setting up servicing centres for the regular maintenance of drones.

In order to encourage drone usage in the farm sector, the State government was also providing a 50 per cent subsidy if anybody purchased a drone. A few farmer-producer agencies have already come forward to buy the technology.

Type certificate and UIN number are mandatory for drone manufacturing companies. Only two companies, IoTechWorld and Garuda Aerospace, were fulfilling these parameters, scientists said. Garuda Aerospace representatives demonstrated drones at the Krishi Vigyan Kendra in Jammikunta twice.

Speaking to Telangana Today, Jammikunta KVK coordinator Venkateshwar Rao said though they have not yet received clear guidelines about the training to be imparted, higher officials were on the job.

They were given a target to carry out drone demonstrations in 250 hectares during Yasangi. Informing that they made an application for the sanction of a drone, he expressed confidence to complete it by January and February.

Though two farmers, one from Bethigal of Veenavanka mandal and another from Dandepalli of Elkathurthi mandal, were using drones to spray pesticides, they may not be trained.

The state government and the Centre had been at loggerheads over the procurement of parboiled rice for almost a year.
The decision has also brought some relief to rice mills which were running into losses since last year.
Around 1,200-1,300 rice mills in the state are in the business of milling parboiled rice and only around 400-500 mill raw rice.
“There had been discussions between the rice millers and the central government when there was a deadlock on the overall rice procurement.","Telangana government and the Centre had been at loggerheads over its procurement for almost a year; now Centre has agreed to procure 0.8 million tonnes

The Union government last week agreed to procure parboiled rice from Telangana amid a low acreage under paddy in Kharif 2022.

The Centre will buy 0.8 million tonnes of parboiled rice grown in Rabi season from the mills in the state, said V Mohan Reddy, general secretary, Telangana Rice Millers Association.

Parboiled rice is rice that has been partially boiled in the husk. The state government and the Centre had been at loggerheads over the procurement of parboiled rice for almost a year.

A delegation of parboiled rice mill managements and other associations met Union Minister of Food and Public Distribution, Piyush Goyal in New Delhi recently to discuss the issue.

The decision has also brought some relief to rice mills which were running into losses since last year.

Telangana is a major producer of parboiled rice. The central government refused to purchase more stocks from the state since the last Rabi season (Rabi 2021-22).

Food Corporation of India (FCI) will not be in a position to accept parboiled rice due to its massive stock in the central pool, Union Minister of State for Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Ashwani kr Choubey had said in a written reply to Parliament in February 2022.

Telangana saw an entire week of protests and blockades over the issue in April. Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao also brought his government’s protest to the national capital.

Rao, along with his state cabinet, legislators, parliamentarians and other party leaders and workers, sat on a day-long maha dharna at Telangana Bhawan in Delhi.

One of the reasons for the U-turn on the procurement seems to be the worries over a lower acreage under paddy in the ongoing Kharif season compared to last year and anticipation of depletion of government stocks.

There is 13.27 per cent less area under paddy in 2022 compared to last year. Some 23.15 million hectares (mha) of paddy had been sown by July 29, 2022, according to data released by the Union agriculture ministry.

This is 3.55 mha less than what was sown in 2021 during the corresponding period.

Less sown area has been reported from 17 states — West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Assam, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Haryana, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Sikkim.

The government is worried about the possible drop in paddy acreage and its likely impact on the public distribution system.

Goyal urged farmers at a July 5 event to grow more paddy this year, which is a departure from the usual government stance of asking farmers to diversify and move beyond paddy.

There is an additional demand for rice this year since wheat production was alarmingly low, forcing the Centre to substitute it with rice under the National Food Security Act, 2013.

“Less sown area has been reported from many states because of low rainfall and parboiled rice from last Rabi season will help in improving the stocks. We are thankful to the government. This will help the farmers and the mills,” said Mohan Reddy.

The mills have been facing financial constraints since 2021. Around 1,200-1,300 rice mills in the state are in the business of milling parboiled rice and only around 400-500 mill raw rice.

Before stopping the procurement in 2021, FCI used to procure parboiled rice from the state regularly, many times both in Kharif and Rabi seasons, due to which more mills were established in milling parboiled rice and invested in infrastructure and machinery.

But then it suddenly said there was no market and stopped purchasing, said Ravi Kanneganti from Rythu Swarajya Vedika, a network of organisations and individuals working with the farmers.

The FCI procured 2.562 million tonnes (MT) of parboiled rice from Telangana in 2020-21, although the quantity was higher in 2019-20 at 4.471 MT.

This fluctuation in policy is hampering both the farmers and rice millers. “A proper planning will help the farmers and the state government to take better decisions on sowing and the market,” said Ravi.

There are also political reasons for the shift, along with less acreage under paddy, he added.

Three weeks ago, Mohan Reddy resigned from Telangana Rashtra Samithi and joined the Bharatiya Janata Party.

“There had been discussions between the rice millers and the central government when there was a deadlock on the overall rice procurement. So there might have been some agreements between the parties and this looks like a politically motivated procurement,” said Ravi.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-08-16/0.07964100_1660631489_rice.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/has-low-paddy-acreage-caused-centre-s-u-turn-on-telangana-parboiled-rice-procurement-84325

But in recent years, heavy rainfall has been occurring at any time in the southwest monsoon season from June to September.

There is a need for the meteorological department to improve forecasts by dividing the city into sub divisions and efficiently used the Doppler weather radar.

Hyderabad metro city urgently requires a disaster mitigation plan keeping in mind the ambitious initiatives of the Telangana government to turn it into a global destination for investments and a livable and safe city.

In the 2022 monsoon season, July turned out to be the wettest month in the city of Hyderabad. The city, the joint capital of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh states recorded excess rainfall of 144.2 mm against the average of 38.1 mm.

The rainfall was particularly heavy during the week of July 6-13, with torrential rains lashing almost the entire Hyderabad and its outskirts. From June 1, starting with the pre-monsoon showers the city received a high of 511 mm rainfall upto August 1, which is 218 mm higher than the average for the entire monsoon season, according to data from the Telangana State Development Planning Society.

The volume of rainfall on July 26, ranged between 6 cms and 10 cms in just two hours around midnight. It left people in several areas struggling with water logging, inundation, overflowing drains. Fluctuating power and outages further aggravated the situation. Homes were flooded with rainwater and sewerage mixed and thousands of people in areas such as Padma Colony of Chaderghat, Ayyappa Colony in Nagole, Kodandaram Nagar and Saraswathi Nagar in Saroornagar, and certain locations of Malakpet, LB Nagar and Dilsukhnagar, were affected.

Usually, September was the month when the city received heavy rainfall. But in recent years, heavy rainfall has been occurring at any time in the southwest monsoon season from June to September. Among the worst extreme weather events in the city in recent years was the record-breaking rainfall (192 mm during October 13-14) and consequent floods in October 2020, which left nearly 50 dead and destruction estimated around Rs. 5000 crores (Rs. 50 billion).

Hyderabad and neighbouring areas have reported extreme rainfall spells of between 15 and 24 cms in a single day on four occasions in the last decade – July 2012, September 2016, September 2019 and October 2020. Before that, the heaviest downpour was 24 cms in 24 hours in August 2000. With this increasing frequency of episodes of extreme rainfall, the river Musi, considered nearly dead has come alive and started to overflow at some point and submerging low lying areas.

While extreme weather changes continue on one hand, on the other, Hyderabad city continues to grow rapidly. Specially over the last two decades, with high rise corporate and residential buildings, flyovers, the metro rail and upcoming ring roads bring with them, arise in traffic, population and waste generation.

Cyberabad, the area of Hyderabad which hosts major global technology companies, has has large residential complexes but not a well-planned drainage system, according to experts.

This urbanisation and transformation, though impressive in external appearance has neither been very planned nor with a definite vision. Consequently, Hyderabad is fast losing its natural courses of rainwater drainage system that were the cornerstone of a visionary plan by engineer Mokshagundem Vishveswarayya in the early 20th century. Moved by the large scale destruction and death of thousands in the September 1908 Musi river floods, the Nizam Osman Ali Khan had specially sought and got the engineer to formulate a long term plan. As per the plan, two large reservoirs, Osmansagar and Himayathsagar were created in 1911. A network of storm water drains (nalas) were connected and the dozens of lakes supplemented in ensuring that the rainwater did not flood any areas of human habitation but ran their course into the river.

Climate change impact

The impact of climate change is manifesting in the form of an increase in the episodes, and in some cases intensity, of extreme weather incidents, especially heavy rainfall in cities across India. “Both the Bay of Bengal and the Arabian Sea which influence cyclonic and other atmospheric events have witnessed a rise in warming over the decades. This in turn is triggering cyclones, floods and heavy rainfall across the central and south India covering over 50,000 sq kms,” says Raghu Murtugudde, a visiting professor at the IIT, Mumbai and Emeritus Professor at the University of Maryland in the United States.

“The erratic distribution of rainfall during the southwest (SW) monsoon period is also due to global warming. Instances of heavy downpour of over 150 mm per day are typically characterised as ‘extreme rainfall events’, he explained.

“The SW monsoon is also pronouncedly effected by El Niño or La Niña factors. This year the latter has been strong from May and the rainfall fluctuations can be attributed to it,” says K. Ashok, a professor at the Centre for Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Studies at the University of Hyderabad.

According to the India Meteorological Department (IMD), 2022 has seen the second highest occurrence of extreme weather events in the last 100 years. In March, the country experienced the highest temperatures in some parts of north India.

While in cities, these weather events take a toll on urban infrastructure, business and everyday life, in rural areas the changes in the rainfall patterns could have a long term impact on the farming operations during the kharif season, especially in those areas dependent on monsoon rains only.

Forecasts and preparedness

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been improving its forecasts of weather and rainfall over the years. It has set up Doppler Radars that give precise data for forecasts. These radars send electromagnetic waves to the rainbearing clouds and the sensors record the intensity of the rain bands. The data is then analysed to provide forecast of rainfall.

In Hyderabad however, the only Doppler Radar located at the old Begumpet airport, was not functional for over a month during the June-July period.

In the absence of the radar, the weather department used other forecasting tools such as light observation, synoptic charts, models and radars from other places, said K. Nagaratna, Director of IMD, Hyderabad.

“It’s a tedious process, looking at all these radars, but we’re making sure the forecasts are correct. If our (Doppler) radar is operational, it will be simple for us to provide forecasts,” she told the media.

While the IMD is well-equipped to make timely and accurate forecasts of urban rains, it has not divided the urban areas into met sub-divisions as suggested in the guidelines of the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), says Marri Shashidhar Reddy, a former MLA of the Secunderabad locality of Hyderabad.

“We suggested watersheds or nalas as sub-divisions. In the case of Hyderabad, we will then have 13. The Doppler Radar can easily give precise rainfall date at these points, which in turn will help the disaster management and local body to swing into action,” Reddy, who was also the former Vice-Chairman of the NDMA explained.

Lessons from 2020

The extreme rainfall event of October 2020 comprehensively exposed the unpreparedness of Hyderabad in handling heavy rains.

With a network of 165 lakes and 13 storm water drains, as well as the Himayatsagar and Osmansagar reservoirs, Hyderabad has a natural solution to absorb large quantities of rainfall and prevent flooding.

However, construction of structures on the nalas, mix up of sewage lines, insufficient desilting before the monsoon and concretisation that stops the water from draining are all making the city more vulnerable to flooding.

In the name of beautification of the city, the basic conservation mechanisms are being sacrificed, which will have a bad effect in the long term, warned D. Narasimha Reddy, a noted environment and development activist. In fact, the lakes, which were a blessing were turned into a curse due to bad management and unplanned growth and expansion of the city. Instead of controlling floods, they are causing floods in low lying areas as their course has been obstructed by concretisation and spread shrunk by land grabbing, he alleged.

“We are still reacting to disasters in a knee jerk manner. Rescue, Relief and Rehabilitation (3 Rs) is the mantra. Never heard of a disaster management authority, discussion or meetings on tackling disasters in Telangana government’s Municipal Administration Department,” laments former MLA Shashidhar Reddy.

The 3 city departments — Urban Development, Metro Water Works and the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation have not been adequately strengthened with capacity to take preventive measures like timely forecasts, evacuation and desilting. Therefore, only once the disaster kicks in, do they jump into action., says Shashidhar Reddy.

Possible solutions and way forward

Most experts warn that unless a long term disaster mitigation plan is put in place and timely, preventive measures are taken, Hyderabad’s growth and image as a good destination for investments and living will be in jeopardy. It will be forced to resort to very expensive solutions like creating underground storage spaces or reservoirs (difficult given the rocky terrain).

However, a set of urgent steps that experts have suggested, to remedy the situation, are prevention of further encroachment of water bodies; better planning of drainage system in the concrete zone of Cyberabad, which is fast expanding; rehabilitation of people living in low lying and catchment areas of lakes and nalas and improving the forecast and alert system of the IMD tailored to cities.

A round table conference organised by Justice Subhashan Reddy Memorial Foundation towards July end on ‘Mitigation of urban floods and the way forward’ came up with a set of recommendations. These include: Set up a State Disaster Management Authority; Implement the NDMA guidelines on Urban flooding and follow the storm water drainage manual of 2019 and prepare a Monsoon Distress Index for citizen-centric disaster management plan.

Telangana is keen on bringing more area under oilseed crops as that would help avoid the problem of plenty the State faced with a massive paddy output as well as lay ground for investments in edible oil refining and food processing sector, Industries and IT Minister K.T.Rama Rao said.

“We are asking farmers to move away from paddy... production was so much that government of India said it cannot procure any more. Over the next five years, 20 lakh acres under paddy in Telangana will systematically be moved away to oil palms,” the Minister told the Indian Vegetable Oil Producers Association (IVPA) Global Roundtable 2022 here on Friday.

Paddy production in Telangana had increased from 6.8 million tonne in 2014 to 25.9 MT this year, he said, pointing to how new irrigation projects of the State government brought an additional 40 lakh acres under cultivation.

A shift, away from paddy, to oil palm, soya bean, groundnut and sunflower will also enhance raw material availability, for edible oil production, without deforestation, something that a few countries are accused of, he said, inviting the industry and company leaders to consider investing in Telangana. More oilseed production would translate into lesser foreign exchange outgo for a country like India that imported 60% of its edible oil requirements, he added.

Highlighting Telangana government’s policy initiatives to improve the ease of doing business levels, especially the TS-iPASS system of time bound clearances for new projects, Mr.Rao said the State has initiated the setting of Special Food Processing Zones on 10,000 acres, which is also bound to be of interest to the investors.

Agriculture Minister S.Niranjan Reddy said after the Centre permitted oil palm cultivation in 25 of the 33 districts, the State has approved 11 companies to set up 25 oil crushing and refining units. While the target is to bring 1.75 lakh acres under oilseed this year, plantation on 40,000 acres could be finished as excessive rainfall came in the way. He was hopeful of more area being brought under the plantation on the back of the State’s pro farmer policies.

IVPA president Sudhakar Desai said the global food crisis triggered by the pandemic and the Ukraine-Russia war have thrown multiple challenges at the edible oil sector ranging from sourcing to managing demand and supply, production and other market dynamics. It has once again turned the spotlight on the need to become self-sufficient in edible oils.

In order to boost valuable groundnut production across Telengana, International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) and Professor Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) have joined forces to conduct 80 demonstration trials of new groundnut varieties across the state. The initiative funded by the Government of Telangana aims to expand groundnut production which is presently only cultivated on 0.3 million hectares of land in Telangana.

Highlighting the project, Dr Jacqueline Hughes, Director General, ICRISAT said she was delighted with the collaboration with the Government of Telangana and PJTSAU, which would likely see much-needed improvements to groundnut cultivation across the state, leading to improved farmer incomes.

“We look forward to drawing upon the Institute’s experience and expertise in developing inclusive and sustainable seed systems and value chains to deliver to farmers across Telangana, high quality, accessible, and lower cost seed,” she added.

Deputy Director General – Research at ICRISAT, Dr Arvind Kumar congratulated all parties for the initiative aimed at not only boosting incomes but incentivising new farmers to enter into groundnut production.

Inaugural Capacity Building Program

About 300 farmers attended the inaugural capacity building programme to accelerate the adoption of the new groundnut varieties held at the Regional Agricultural Research Station (RARS) in Palem, Nagarkurnool district, Telengana.

ICRISAT Accelerated Crop Improvement Research Program Director, Dr Sean Mayes applauded participants for their involvement in the trials and said ICRISAT was pleased to be promoting another initiative to improve farmer incomes.

“We are pleased to partner with farmers and regional agricultural centres in Telangana to work together to enhance farmer profitability and importantly, learn from each other during this project,” said Dr Mayes.

During the capacity-building programme, participants were exposed to quality seed production techniques and potential innovations to promote groundnut production and value chains.

Leaflets in the local language detailing good agricultural practices in groundnut were distributed to farmers at the event for ongoing reference material.

Speaking at the training, Dr Sujatha, Principal Scientist (Oilseeds), Regional Agricultural Research Station, Palem said that access to new seed varieties for groundnut production remained a challenge, considering a farmer needs close to 100 kg of seed per acre of land.

“The availability of poor quality and mixed varieties of groundnut seed is also a concern that needs to be addressed and we are working with ICRISAT to ensure that new varieties will soon be available to farmers,” added Dr M Sujatha.

Dr Janila Pasupuleti, Cluster Leader-Crop Breeding, Accelerated Crop Improvement, ICRISAT, added that the inability of farmers to adopt new seed varieties is partly due to their non-availability and fear of drawing lower profits.

She emphasised that farmer adoption of new groundnut varieties such as high oleic acid varieties would help them achieve higher yields, profit and potential new export opportunities while promoting best agricultural practices.

The project

Groundnut Value Chain Innovations to Enhance Farmer Profitability and Promote Oil, Food and Confectionery Industries in Telangana is funded by the Government of Telangana and led by PJTSAU in collaboration with ICRISAT.

PJTSAU, with support from ICRISAT, is conducting location-specific research, identification of genotypes, and multi-location trials of varieties developed by ICRISAT to deliver suitable varieties to Telangana and improve groundnut seed systems in the state.

Seed production of India’s first high oleic acid groundnut varieties ‘Girnar 4’ developed by ICRISAT in partnership with the ICAR–Directorate of Groundnut Research (ICAR-DGR), was undertaken on four acres of land at RARS-Palem during this year’s rainy season.

Future plans

There are plans to engage with seed corporations, farmer seed entrepreneurs and farmer producer organisations (FPOs) to ensure access to quality Girnar 4 and 5 seeds.

Addressing the inaugural session in virtual mode, Union Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Shri Kailash Choudhary said, there is a need to intensify our research and development activities and ensure that it reaches out to our farmers at the ground level. ""In order to increase the farmers' income, we need to decrease their loan burden, provide developed seeds, create market linkage and storage facilities. States need to work proactively at the field level, the Centre is always there to provide assistance,"" he said.

Stressing on the importance of Natural Farming, the Minister said that there is a need to shift from chemicals, fertilisers based farming. ""Technology needs to be extended to our farmers. Only research can't do it alone, the end product of the research needs to reach the farmer,"" he added.

The minister said that we need to be Aatmanirbhar in Krishi, then only India will become Aatmanirbhar. He wished the participants and said that the outcome of the meeting will definitely go a long way in helping our agriculture sector.

He also emphasized that such type of review is essential not only to examine the progress, but to pin-point the problems and chalk out the possible solutions. States like Odisha, West Bengal, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are becoming highly affected by the adverse climatic conditions. Therefore, new climate-smart technologies for the farmers should be developed. He claimed that until the agricultural activities are taken as a commercial venture, one can’t reap full potential benefits and get remunerative returns.

Secretary, Department of Agricultural Research & Education (DARE)&Director General (DG), ICAR, Dr. Himanshu Pathak stated the objectives of the programme and emphasized that in spite of COVID-19 pandemic, India’s exports of Agricultural and Processed Food products increased by 13% as compared to previous year. However, the share in world export of food product is only about 3% due to low level of processing and lower value addition. Also low level of processing is reflected in the composition of India’s food export basket which essentially consists of primary produce like rice, flour, sugar, meat, fish, etc. He also expressed his concern about the low productivity of this region due to various reasons like poor soil quality, low use of fertilizer, insect-pest infestation and high dependence on monsoon rainfall.

Dr. RK Singh, ADG (CC&FFC), ICAR welcomed all the dignitaries and Dr. B.C. Patra, Director of ICAR-NRRI, Cuttack and Member Secretary, RCM-II offered the vote of thanks in the inaugural programme. After the inaugural session was over, State-wise problems and research needs/development issues were discussed during the technical session. Action Taken Report (ATR) with respect to the issues finalized during earlier meeting were deliberated and discussion made to prepare a roadmap for the development of agriculture including animal husbandry, dairy, fisheries, natural resource management and human resource development in the region. This meeting will help to establish the link between ICAR and state governments for identifying state specific problems related to agricultural and allied aspects and offering suitable solutions through achievements and accomplishments of the National Agricultural Research System (NARS) of the concerned states within specific timeline.

The ICAR has set up eight Regional Committees on the basis of agro-climatic regions. The purpose of the Regional Committee is to provide a forum to the researchers and the State Government functionaries to examine the major gaps in the current research and training efforts in agriculture, animal husbandry and fisheries; to identify priorities; and to decide agenda of research and extension education in different agro-ecological regions of the country for the coming two years. A research agenda of national relevance in the areas of agricultural technology assessment, refinement and transfer is set up for discussion in the regular meetings of the Regional Committee, which is held once in two years.

Recently, Telangana’s agricultural minister, S Niranjan Reddy, also called for the inclusion of millets in PDS to stimulate demand for this cereal.
These initiatives will increase the demand and consumption of millets, which is a key driver for mainstreaming millets.
“Including millets in PDS would be a game changer for combating malnutrition and mitigating climate change,” said professor Srijit Mishra, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai.
Districts should be locally self-sufficient in terms of millet production, procurement, processing and distribution.","Subsidised cereals distributed under PDS have increased the consumption of excessive starch instead of pulses, legumes, vegetables, nuts and milk, which provide wholesome nutrition

India was ranked 107 of 121 countries in the Global Hunger Index 2022. This is despite the country running the largest food distribution network, which feeds over 800 million people — around 10 per cent of the world’s population. Malnutrition continues to be a significant challenge in India even after 75 years of independence.

The government introduced the Public Distribution System (PDS) to alleviate hunger by providing staple foods like rice and wheat at a nominal cost to economically weaker households.

Also read: Government push to coarse cereals as climate change affects wheat, paddy cultivation

“The rice-wheat centric policies have amplified poor nutritional outcomes,” according to eminent economist Jean Dreze. The cereal-based PDS may have reduced hunger, but the problem of malnutrition persists, he underlined.

India is facing the triple burden of malnutrition, obesity and micronutrient deficiencies. The country is home to 224.3 million undernourished people, according to a report released by the Food and Agriculture Organization in 2019-2021.

Over 80 per cent adolescents in India suffer from ‘hidden hunger’, noted a report published by United Nations International Children’s Emergency Fund. Hidden hunger is a deficiency of micronutrients that affects health and learning ability and aggravates the vicious cycle of malnutrition and poverty.

Sustainable food

Subsidised cereals distributed under PDS have increased the consumption of excessive starch instead of pulses, legumes, vegetables, nuts and milk, which provide wholesome nutrition. It is high time to adopt nutrient-dense diets. PDS has a crucial role in procuring and distributing a wider variety of traditional and nutritious grains.

Small-scale farmers in the dryland and rainfed areas grew millets as part of an intercropping system, along with pulses, legumes, oilseeds and tubers. Millets like barnyard, ragi (finger millet), kodo, foxtail, little, proso and sorghum are known as nutri-cereals due to their richness in dietary fibre, proteins, calcium, iron, magnesium, niacin, amino acids and other micronutrients.

Regular consumption of millets can significantly improve key nutrition parameters among children and women. Millets can improve haemoglobin levels and reduce iron deficiency. There has been a growing awareness, particularly among urban consumers, that millets are a powerhouse of nutrition, good for diabetes and obesity and reduce the chances of heart and cardiovascular diseases.

Recognising the nutritional value of millets, the Government of India revalorised millets as ‘Nutri-cereals’ in 2018. The government has also created a sub-mission under the National Food Security Mission to encourage millet cultivation and its inclusion in PDS.

Recently, Telangana’s agricultural minister, S Niranjan Reddy, also called for the inclusion of millets in PDS to stimulate demand for this cereal. Telangana is taking steps to include millets in public diets by introducing them to integrated child development services (ICDS).

Millets are climate-resilient crops that can grow with less water and chemical inputs. Millets-based production system helps reduce the carbon footprint and improve energy use efficiency.

Paddy requires 1,200-1,500 millilitres (ml) of water, whereas millets require just about 600-800 ml water per acre. For farmers depending on rainfed agriculture, millets are a major source of income and nutrition.

Millets are smart-food, said Joanna Kane-Potaka, deputy director general of the International Rice Research Institute. “They are a blessing for small-scale farmers facing climate change, suffering from poverty poverty and failing to meet adequate nutrition.”

Mainstreaming millets in PDS

Since millets are nutrient-dense cereals with the potential to address India’s food and nutrition security, mainstreaming them under PDS could address the challenge of micronutrient deficiency.

Many states have introduced millets in their food security programmes. Karnataka became the first state to include jowar and ragi in PDS in July 2015 in accordance with recommendations in the National Food Security Act, 2013.

The Odisha government launched Odisha Millets Mission (OMM) in 2017-2018 to revive millets. OMM has been instrumental in creating an enabling ecosystem for better production, developing a millet value chain, campaigning for behaviour change and increasing household consumption of millets.

The state government procures ragi from farmers at MSP and transfers payment via online benefit transfer mode. Farmers producer organisations (FPO) have been empanelled as procurement agencies. This has addressed the challenges of poor transportation facilities in remote areas, thus minimising the gap between mandi (wholesale market) and farmers.

OMM has introduced ragi in various social safety net programmes such as PDS, Supplementary Nutrition Programme under ICDS, Mid-Day Meal scheme and tribal hostels. Under PDS, for instance, two kilograms of ragi per ration cardholder was supplied as a rice substitute. During 2017-18 to 2022-23, over five lakh quintals of ragi were distributed to 18,038,187 ration cardholders.

“Promoting millets is about ensuring equity and justice to vulnerable tribal farmers,” according to Odisha’s Chief Minister, Naveen Patnaik. Efforts have been taken up to promote and increase procurement of little and foxtail millets under MSP. These initiatives will increase the demand and consumption of millets, which is a key driver for mainstreaming millets.

“Including millets in PDS would be a game changer for combating malnutrition and mitigating climate change,” said professor Srijit Mishra, Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research, Mumbai.

Grains required for distribution under PDS should be procured from farmers at MSP. But there is a need for a comprehensive policy to strengthen the existing system.

Challenges & way forward

At the outset, including millet under PDS and ensuring an elevated MSP may seem like an effective strategy to boost millet production and consumption. But there are several flip sides that need urgent policy attention.

In Karnataka, for instance, the cost of production of a quintal of paddy is much lower and the yields are much higher than ragi. And to make ragi compete with other high-value crops, the government needs to increase the MSP for farmers.

Despite millet being supplied under PDS in Karnataka, beneficiaries source a significant proportion of their rice consumption from markets, revealed a study conducted by MS Swaminathan Research Foundation. Only around 25 per cent of households consume millets distributed under PDS since there is a strong preference for rice.

Andhra Pradesh undertook a pilot project in 2018, but as procurement was done through the tendering process, the benefits to the farmers were limited.

The state government now plans to re-introduce millets into the PDS but through a more equitable process that would benefit both farmers and consumers.

“Shifting consumer preferences is key,” said Khader Vali, popularly known as India’s ‘Millet Man’. Behavioural change campaigns, enabling policies and investments are needed to bring millet back to people’s diets. A comprehensive design framework is imperative instead of piecemeal approaches.

The comprehensive model of OMM to improve nutrition in tribal districts has been recognised by World Food Programme. Similarly. NITI Aayog and the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Government of India, recommended that the OMM operational framework should be adopted by other states.

Decentralised PDS is imperative. Districts should be locally self-sufficient in terms of millet production, procurement, processing and distribution. This will reduce costs of transport and storage, minimise the risk of spoilage during storage and reduce corruption and leakages.

OMM has developed the standards for millet processing and value-added machinery and set up processing machinery at panchayat and block levels that are operated and managed by women self-help groups and FPOs.

Such decentralised people-centric approaches have created livelihood opportunities. More research and development are needed to develop efficient machinery for millet that can work in energy-constrained rural areas.

The average yield of millets is 1,111 kg per hectare (ha), far less than 2,600 kg for paddy and 3,500 kg for wheat, according to Smart Food, a global initiative led by the ICRISAT.

Promoting agronomic practices, accessibility to quality seed and locally suitable varieties would help in boosting production to balance demand and supply.

Through such comprehensive and innovative approaches, PDS can be reformed to include millets. And, with the inclusion of millets in public diets, India may well improve its ranking in the Global Hunger Index.

The data from the drought-monitoring system is available at grid level and can be visualised up to taluk level, Amarnath said.
Therefore, platforms like SADMS become important for timely monitoring of the droughts and preparation, he added.","State-level workshops will be conducted to help users interpret data from the system

A new satellite-based drought-monitoring tool will be able to indicate the presence of drought and its level of severity, providing authorities the maximum possible lead time to put mitigation strategies into place in India and across South Asia.

In India, the South Asia Drought Monitoring System (SADMS) was developed by the International Water Management Institute (IWMI) and the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR), the country’s premier agricultural research institution.

It has been tested in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Nepal, Maldives, Afghanistan and Bhutan.

The system will not just monitor the drought conditions but also incorporate this information of real-time weather updates and open-access satellite data, and provide extension workers as well as agriculture and water resources authorities with all the information needed to forecast, monitor and manage drought on a weekly basis.

India featured as one of the severely drought-impacted countries in the United Nation’s latest drought assessment released May 11, 2022. Nearly two-thirds of the country suffered drought during 2020-2022. Severe droughts have reduced India’s gross domestic product by 2-5 per cent over the 20 years from 1998-2017, studies estimated.

Not only India, the whole of South Asia faced several droughts in the recent decades and 50 major droughts have been reported since 1990, affecting over 750 million people with economic damages estimated at $7 billion.

There was previously no integrated end-to-end drought monitoring and management system available for South Asia, said Giriraj Amarnath, leader of the SADMS programme and research group leader for water, risks to development and resilience at IWMI.

The data from the drought-monitoring system is available at grid level and can be visualised up to taluk level, Amarnath said. “We wanted the data to reach the appropriate users, so that they could make informed decisions on how best to mitigate the drought risk.”

“We are working closely with ICAR-Central Research Institute for Dryland Agriculture and at the taluk level, the district officials can see the value and visualise if there is a surplus or rain deficit,” he explained.

If there is a deficit, ICAR, which works with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (agriculture resource centres), can take this information to them and also at the state government level and interpret what action needs to be taken, he added.

Through this, the authorities can put in action district-wise contingency plans, which include measures like changing the crop or switch to drought-tolerant varieties.

IWMI has been testing SADMS by validating it at the district level. The platform is already in operation in the state of Telangana. They use the system to know when to initiate their strategy for mitigating drought, according to Amarnath. “If the seasonal forecast indicates that a moderate drought is anticipated, for example, then the department might advise farmers to switch from planting rice to a more drought-tolerant crop, such as millet.”

From 2017, ICAR used SADMS to implement real-time contingency measures. It helped farmers in three districts of Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra to obtain drought-tolerant seeds, develop supplementary irrigation and apply potassium nitrate (which helps seedlings cope better with dry conditions).

“As a result, crop yields for soybean increased by 7–8 quintals (700–800 kilograms) per 0.4 hectare, pigeon pea by 5–6 quintals per acre and cotton by 12 to 14 quintals per acre,” he said.

The input data comes into the platform from India Meteorological Department (IMD) and Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM). This includes soil moisture, precipitation, temperature, wind speed and available cloud ratio. The scientists will also factor in historical droughts and their conditions.

“We are looking at how to bring drought science into national institutions, state governments and districts in order to have useful information for decision makers to have sufficient lead time so that drought is mitigated to the extent possible,” said Alok Sikka, country representative, IWMI.

A labourer dries chillies at a farm in Lakshmipuram village in Telangana's Hanumakonda district, which lost 51 per cent of its chilli crops to a new species of thrips this year

Chilli farmers in Telangana’s Subakkapalli village, Bhopalapalli district, are living their worst nightmare. A new pest, black thrips (Thrips parvispinus), has destroyed over 40 hectares (ha) of standing crop in a matter of months.

In Sidduri Ravindra Rao’s farm, the initial signs of the attack were reported in the first week of December last year. He increased the frequency of pesticide spraying to three times a week from the recommended two times, but the entire crop on his 0.8 hectares farm perished within a week.

On December 15, he died by suicide. His brother Bhaskar Rao told Down To Earth that Ravindra was relying on this year’s produce to repay his loan of over Rs 20 lakh. “First, untimely heavy rainfall destroyed our crops. This season, we lost it to pest attacks,” he said.

Farmers in Jairam Thanda village in Warangal district also narrate similar stories. The black-coloured and pinhead-sized pest has ruined the entire 20 ha under chilli in the village.

Banath Venkamma, a chilli farmer from the village, says when he first saw the pest on his 0.4-ha farm, he contacted the local agriculture extension office, which recommended continuing with the existing pesticides.

“I used at least six different pesticides but nothing worked. The pest has completely destroyed 70 per cent of my crop and has partially destroyed the remainder. Usually, chillies we grow are 7 to 10 centimetres long, but this time they are barely 5 cm long,” she said.

Rapid spread

T parvispinusis, a member of the thrips group of sucking pests, is an invasive species from Southeast Asia that has been documented in different countries including Australia, Thailand and Greece.

It causes more damage than S dorsalis, the thrips pest native to India. By attacking the flowers and not just leaves, T parvispinusis removes any hope of the crop growing from it. The pest was first reported in India in 2017 when it destroyed papaya farms in Bengaluru, Karnataka.

“This is the first time it has caused such widespread destruction in the country. In the past year, its population has increased by many folds,” said V Sridhar, principal scientist at the Indian Council of Agricultural Research-Indian Institute of Horti-cultural Research in Bengaluru. He is part of the team of scientists appointed by the Centre to research the pest attack and its possible management solutions.

As per the information received by the team, since October 2021, the pest has caused widespread losses in hundreds of villages across 34 contagious districts in six states:

Telangana

Andhra Pradesh

Maharashtra

Karnataka

Tamil Nadu

Chhattisgarh

They have also received information about similar attacks in Gujarat. Andhra Pradesh and Telangana are, however, the worst-hit, where at least 0.36 million ha — roughly three times the size of Delhi — has been destroyed. The remaining states have not released official figures so far.

T parvispinusis is also polyphagous, which means it spreads to other crops. The Central team’s scientists visited farms in Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka between October and December 2021 and found the pest in sweet pepper, brinjal, black gram, pigeon pea, watermelon, cucumber, bottle gourd, mango, and cotton, among others.

“This was not on a large scale, but the presence was noted,” Sridhar said.

Without a cover

The growing spread of the pest in India is worrying for two reasons.

First, the country is the world’s largest producer, consumer and exporter of chillies and has 40 per cent of the world’s area under the crop.

Second, chilli cultivation requires huge investment ranging anywhere between Rs 2.5-3 lakh per ha.

In Telangana, most chilli farmers pay an additional Rs 20,000-25,000 to take land on lease. This year, the farmers say their investment in pesticides also shot up because of the attack. In such a situation, the crop loss has pushed many farmers to the brink.

DTE in last week of March visited six villages in four districts of Telangana and found several cases of farmer suicides. While the state government has not released any numbers, a survey by Telangana-based non-profits Rythu Swarajya Vedika and Human Rights Forum shows that more than 50 farmers have died by suicide in the districts of Warangal, Mahbubabad, Hanumakonda, Bhopalapalli, Khammam and Bhadradri Kothagudem.

In Subakkapalli village of Bhopalapalli, Bhaskar Rao blames the government for the deaths of his brother and other farmers. “Nobody came to talk to us or make us aware of the pest or how to deal with it. We were making our own guesses,” Bhaskar Rao said.

Telangana is yet to announce compensation for the crop damage. The state does not have its own crop insurance scheme and has also opted out of the Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Bima Fasal Yojana.

The state government runs the cash support scheme, Rythu Bandhu, under which Rs 12,350 per ha per season is transferred to the bank accounts of farmers ahead of the rabi and kharif seasons. Another scheme, Rythu Bima, promises Rs 5 lakh to the families of farmers who have died by suicide.

But these are not enough. Hari Krishna of the Human Rights Forum says by introducing Rythu Bandhu and Rythu Bima schemes the government has absolved itself of the responsibility for crop loss. Besides, only landed families benefit from the schemes; vulnerable landless farmers are simply not covered, he adds.

Though the state announces compensation packages during large-scale crop loss, Kiran Kumar Vissa of Rythu Swarajya Vedika says it seldom reaches people. “Farmers are still waiting for the compensation announced in January 2021 for crop loss caused by heavy rainfall,” Vissa alleged.

Ripple effect

MV Madhusudhan, deputy director of Telangana’s horticulture department, agrees that the pest attack has substantially reduced the yield of chilli this year — from the usual 5-6 tonnes per ha to 2.5 tonnes or less.

Its effect can be seen at the Warangal mandi, Asia’s second largest chilli market. In February and March 2022, the mandi received 27,514 tonnes of chillies, nearly half of what it got in the two months last year (52,106 tonnes).

“The pest attack and the hailstorm in January have created a supply problem. There could be a high shortage of red chillies in the coming months in the market,” said BV Rahul, selection grade secretary, Agricultural Produce Market Committee, Warangal.

The price of the crop has already skyrocketed. Currently, average mandi price of chilli is Rs 1.8-2 lakh per tonne, which is almost double the usual rate of Rs 1.1-1.3 lakh. “On March 30, a farmer received a record price of Rs 5.2 lakh a tonne because there is an acute shortage of good quality chillies this season,” said Rahul.

Farmers said the inflated price will not do them any good as the yield is low. They are now worried about a similar attack in the next crop season.

Conducive climate

On February 4, 2022, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar said in Parliament that the change in climatic conditions during the cropping season might be responsible for the spread of T parvispinus.

Scientists agree that weather aberrations could have aided in the proliferation of the pest. “Thrips usually proliferate in hot and dry conditions, but this particular species, T parvispinus, thrives in hot and humid conditions,” said Sridhar.

Warangal and nearby districts received heavy rainfall in September, October and November 2021. During the southwest monsoon, the state received 40 per cent more rain than usual.

In the second week of January this year, several parts of Telangana had experienced hailstorms and heavy rains. Continuous stretches of crops further allowed the pest to spread rapidly. In Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and Karnataka, chilli cultivation has increased by 30-35 per cent in the past one year.

The pest is also known to displace formerly established species from habitats. This has been seen in Indonesia and is now being observed in India as well. This year, it has replaced S dorsalis. This could have happened due to indiscriminate use of pesticides.

Farmers told DTE that unapproved pesticides are being sold at shops, and since they are cheaper than the approved ones, distressed farmers use them freely.

“As the replacement was observed this year alone, we need to monitor the various chilli pest species to understand if this is permanent or temporary,” said Sridhar.

He added that the pest has to be tackled in an integrated way from the first sight: “Farmers have to use blue-coloured sticky traps and all farmers must use the same methods to keep the pests away.”

A 2021 paper from scientists at the National Bureau of Agricultural Insect Resources, Bengaluru, recommends destroying infected crop fields to stop the spread of the pest to newer locations.

It added that constant monitoring, microbial biopesticide-based management practices, such as the use of neem oil, pongamia oil, or soap solution in heavily infested sites, and judicious use of chemical insecticides as well as fertilisers.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-05-12/0.39180400_1652347354_p30-31dlpix-043a4735.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/chilli-under-attack-new-thrips-species-destroys-farms-in-6-states-82811

Some businesses have shaped our economies and societies more than others, whether by feeding us cheeseburgers or by controlling commodities. Can they also give an impetus to organic farming, which has been progressing at a tardy pace in India?

Latest data available with the government for 2018-19 showed that only 2 per cent of the country’s net sown area is under organic farming and 1.3 per cent of the farmers follow the practice.

To understand how private players can play their part to encourage farmers as well as influence consumer choices, researchers with Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) analysed the functioning of one of the country’s oldest organic food companies, Sresta Natural Bioproducts Limited.

Based in Hyderabad, Telangana, Sresta forayed into the organic food business in 2004. Organic food was just an exotic idea then, with most farmers relying on chemical inputs for improved crop yield; the government introduced schemes to support and promote organic farming only a decade later.

So, Rajshekhar Reddy Seelam, who had launched Sresta as a farm-to-fork initiative, decided to follow a two-pronged strategy. On the ground, the company offers constant support to farmers to wean them off chemical inputs and shift to organic farming. To create an assured market, it also procures, processes and markets the produce.

At the same time, Sresta invests in massive awareness programmes about organic farming and its benefits for human health and the environment, to create consumer demand for the products.

Today, the company’s brand name “24 Mantra” has the largest market share in organic food products, as per the India: Organic Industry Market Report-2021 released by the United States Department of Agriculture’s Foreign Agricultural Service.

The company has grown from 40 farmers to 40,000 farmers, covering nearly 81,000 hectares (ha) in 15 states. From procuring wheat, mustard, gram and barley initially, Sresta’s list now includes nearly 200 products, from flour, grains, pulses, millets, dry fruits and spices to flours, cold-pressed oil, pickles, cookies, culinary pastes, jams and ready-to-eat products.

Seelam said farmers in the country are hesitant to take up organic farming due to overreliance on chemical inputs and fears of reduced yield. Hence, Sresta tries to eliminate all the steps that make farming a cumbersome venture.

Sresta procures its produce from over 80 project areas established across the country. In each project area, which spans 15-20 km radius and comprises 200-300 farmers, Sresta has deployed ground staff for deciding on the procurement targets for the year.

“Government mandis do not have a separate procurement system for organic produce, while Sresta allots a time and date for procurement,” said Subhas Chander, an organic farmer from Nawalgarh in Jhunjhunu district, Rajasthan, where the company first started operations.

Chander grows wheat, mustard, gram and pearl millet, which the company procures at a rate 8-12 per cent higher than the minimum support price offered by the government. “I receive Rs 200-300 more per 100 kg for my organic wheat,” Chander said.

Karni Ram, another organic farmer from Pillyon ke Daahar village in Rajasthan’s Sikar district also informed CSE researchers that from Sresta, he receives Rs 300 more per 100 kg of wheat; Rs 500 more for mustard and Rs 400 more for fenugreek.

Farmers said they also save on cost of loading, unloading produce and mandi tax with Sresta.

Sresta’s field staff conduct regular training and awareness programmes for the farmers to improve crop yield and reduce farm input costs.

“I used to practise organic farming based on my limited understanding of the concept,” said Manoj Kumar, a young farmer from Nawalgarh. “After joining Sresta in 2015, I received training on selection of seeds and planting materials, preparing organic insecticides for pest management and harvest techniques,” he added.

Sresta also provides support for organic crops it does not procure. For example, it has developed a package of practices to grow potatoes for farmers in Nawalgarh, which has lowered cultivation costs by 30-40 per cent.

In Madhya Pradesh, Om Prakash, an organic farmer from Lasudi village, Mandsaur district, narrated how his association with Sresta has provided him new income opportunities. “Sresta encourages farmers to use their own local seed varieties. So I not only sell my crops as grains but also as seeds, which is more profitable,” added Prakash, who majorly grows wheat, mustard and soybean.

Karni Ram said that the company also sends scientists to the field to advise farmers on specific yield issues.

To assure the consumers about the quality of the produce, Sresta helps farmers obtain organic certification under the National Programme for Organic Production, which allows for exports and bears the cost of the process. Scientists at Sresta constantly research on improving packaging and quality of the products. They have, for instance, found a way to enhance the shelf life of jaggery-based products by reducing the crystallisation of the raw produce.

To increase its consumer base, Sresta has tied up with over 7,500 retail outlets across the globe, which includes modern trade stores, general stores and ethnic stores such as Aditya Birla Retail Limited, Food Bazaar, Hyper City, Walmart Best Price, Spencer’s and Godrej Nature’s Basket. The company also makes its products available over e-commerce platforms, advertises its products through campaigns and through social media, shares recipes that use its products and spreads awareness on the benefits of organic food.

In the past three years, the company has made on average a profit of Rs 7.56 crore, with Rs 10.39 crore in 2020-21 despite COVID-19. Some 55 per cent of its sales are from India and 45 per cent from other 34 countries. Some 75 per cent of international sales are from the US, through a wholly owned subsidiary called Fyve Elements.

However, there have been some problems. “A few years ago, payment was delayed and I could not meet expenses. I had to discontinue work with Sresta,” said Bapu Lal, a farmer from Jhakeda village in Mandsaur. To overcome this hurdle, Sresta has appointed in certain areas an aggregator-farmer, to procure on its behalf. In such cases, farmers are paid right away, but the rates are slightly lower and the aggregator gets a commission of 1 per cent on the total amount.

If the company plans to roll this out on a large-scale, it must ensure farmers’ share is not affected. Some farmers also say that Sresta stops procurement of a particular crop if its target is met, which leaves them with unsold produce. The company can look into raising procurement levels based on the crop grown and the stocks available.

Finally, as with most organic players, Sresta’s high prices dissuade consumers. Negotiating pricing policies on e-commerce platforms, and government support for mark-eting will help ease costs, which can lower the final sale prices. Generating demand through awareness on the benefits of organic products will also help both the company and the sector grow.

End-to-end support

Sresta Natural Bioproducts Limited has expanded the “farm-to-fork” philosophy to boost consumption of organic produce as well as to promote chemical-free practices among farmers

Pre-sowing Training on organic practices for each crop and season, which include composting techniques, preparation of organic inputs and support in transition from conventional agriculture Sowing and harvest Sresta’s ground staff, who aid in training and procurement, inform farmers on the annual targets and maintain records of the types of crops sown. They monitor fields, record practices followed for weeding, pest and disease treatment and address farmers’ concerns. Before harvest, they inspects the growth of crops and trains farmers on suitable practices to safeguard the produce Post-harvest Random samples of crops are picked, mixed and sent to Hyderabad for quality tests Procurement Farmers whose samples have passed the quality tests gather for procurement. In some areas, procurement is coordinated by aggregator-farmers. The procurement happens in collection centres 10-15 km from villages.

Crops are stored at local warehouses and transported to processing centres within a week Payment Payment is transferred into the bank accounts of the farmers within 14-21 days. In case the produce has been collected by an aggregator, payment is done right at the time of procurement Processing Produce goes through two rounds of processing wherein it is cleaned, checked and packaged under the brand name “24 Mantra” Marketing The company advertises products through campaigns and through social media, shares recipes that use its products and spreads awareness on the benefits of organic food Sales The products are sold in over 7,500 retail outlets, modern trade stores, general stores, ethnic stores and e-commerce platforms, at prices 40-60 per cent higher than those for conventional products.

The policy, which aims to codify norms, processes, guidelines, etc. for handling agricultural data, is open to comments from the public until 6th August.

Apart from a clause to monetise data, the policy also proposes instituting grievance redressal and data management officers for various entities, including government departments, handling agricultural data, a grievance redressal mechanism, and key principles on which data governance frameworks, Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), etc. can be built for agricultural data. We have summarised these below.

Why it matters? In the report, the state government says “The Government of Telangana has been giving a high priority to the development of the agriculture sector in the state, given that 5 million farmers depend on it and that the sector contributes to about 15% of the GSDP…The Government is keen to make a further impact on the levels of production, productivity, and profitability of the farmers by promoting digital agriculture and extensive use of technologies including the emerging technologies like AI, ML, IoT, Drones and satellite imagery.”

Agri-tech initiatives, even from the Central government are up-and-coming in India.Telangana’s policy could guide the Central government’s approach in this regard as well, as the latter had said last year that it was working on creating a data policy for agriculture.

Comments can be sent in through this form specified in the policy or sent via email to osd_itc@telangana.gov.in with a copy to consultant-itc@telangana.gov.in. The paper also specifies a format in which such comments should be sent.

Committee set up for governing agricultural data

The policy proposes setting up an interdepartmental committee (IDC) which would lay out purposes under which personal data can be processed, SOPs for managing them, as well as the sharing of such data. Officials from the following departments will be a part of the committee, the policy says however it doesn’t specify any ranks for them:

(a) Irrigation & CAD Department;

(b) Planning Department;

(c) Agriculture and Cooperation Department;

(d) Land Administration;

(e) Agriculture Department;

(f) Telangana State Remote Application Centre; and

(g) Information Technology and Communications Department

Even besides the above, the IDC could invite officials from other departments which deal with agricultural, horticultural, and allied activities the policy says.

The principles Telangana plans to govern agricultural data with

For creating Standard Operating Procedures: As aforementioned the IDC will create SOPs. With regards to the same, the policy outlines certain aspects for which the SOPS will have to create procedures, guidelines, formats, checklists, and templates:

i) Data Management Officer

ii) Capacity building

iii) Compliance requirements

iv) De-identification and anonymisation

v) Quality of datasets

vi) Access control

vii) Technical methods for data sharing

viii) Data Service Providers.

For creating data governance frameworks: The policy asks that entities which deal with agricultural data form data governance frameworks for themselves. For the same it lays down certain guidelines.

Further, the policy categorises such entities into two groups:

i) Agriculture Information Users (AIU) or ‘persons, business entities, public and private organisation that need and use data in accordance with the policy’

ii) Data Service Providers (DSP) which compile data sets that AIUs can use, such as related to agricultural credit, crop management, pest management, etc. create data governance frameworks for themselves.

The principles for the frameworks are as follows:

i. Data architecture – Standards, rules and policies shall be defined by the entity to describe how data is collected, stored, integrated, processed and used internally within the entity. A comprehensive data architecture should be laid out that specifies the various functionaries responsible for, and the processes and technology used in data management.

ii. Meta-data management – The concerned entity shall devise a method to capture, manage and publish meta-data information with defined access controls.

iii. Data quality – Standards and procedures should be adopted to maintain the integrity and quality of data, in accordance with standards and best practices.

iv. Auditability – Decisions and processes related to data governance must be auditable, as per prescribed standards.

v. Accountability – Accountability of different teams within an entity must be prescribed in a manner that introduces checks-and-balances between domain and technology teams, and between those who create/collect information, those who manage it, those who use it, and those who introduce standards and compliance requirements.

Purposes for processing personal data: While the policy says that the IDC will outline purposes for which personal data can be processed under it, it outlines some such purposes in its annexure. To elaborate further on this, some of these are as follows:

For agricultural credit:

Assessment of credit worthiness and extension of short, medium, and long-term loans to farmers and the associated processes like recovery.

Extending credit to farmers basing on Negotiable Warehouse Receipts (NWR)

For Insurance



Providing crop insurance cover and disbursing of the amount assured on meeting the defined criteria.

Providing insurance cover for farm machinery

For payment services:

Enabling electronic payments and receipts arising out of the transactions relating the purposes specified in this standard.

Types of data covered by the policy

The policy defines agricultural data as ‘data that is created, collected, processed, shared or used in the agricultural sector.’ It further classifies these into the following:

Agricultural operations and management

1. Agricultural credit

2. Agricultural insurance

3. Supply chain-related data

4. Rolling and fixed asset data

5. Farm machinery

6. Compliance-related data

Agricultural production

1. Seed / variety sown

2. Dates of sowing/ field operations

3. Water management

4. Pest and disease management

5. Yield data

6. Land records

7. Field boundaries, GIS, GPS data

HYDERABAD: In a research finding that will be music to the ears of both environmentalists and the farmers, a team from the ICRISAT has come up with the ways to enhance soil carbon in the drylands where it is relatively less.

Soil carbon is critical for crop yield as it helps in increasing plant nutrient reserves, available water for longer periods and also plays a crucial role in global carbon cycling through representing the largest pool of carbon.

The result of a modelling study conducted by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) team between 2020 and 2022 revealed that with the right combination of fertiliser, biochar and irrigation, the soil carbon can potentially be increased by as much as 300 per cent over 30 years in 13 districts of Odisha and Maharashtra, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.

Speaking to TNIE, Dr Girish Chander, co-lead of the project who studied the carbon sequestration, said: “Soil carbon is an important soil property as it is closely related to crop yield and aids sustainability. Most of agricultural soils in drylands are low in carbon, and have the potential not only to reduce its own emissions, but also from other sectors as well to enhance the quality of soil and water resources.’’

“Contrary to popular belief, soil is a storehouse of carbon as it contains about 2,500 billion tonnes, whereas air and plants together consist of about 1,350 billion tonnes of carbon. Thus in drylands where soil carbon levels are low, sequestering carbon in soil is critical to boost crop productivity and contribute to climate adaptation and mitigation. Managing agricultural soil as carbon sinks is vital as agricultural systems account for greenhouse emissions though the levels are not as high as non-agricultural practices like vehicular pollution and others,’’ he added.

Referring to use of fertilisers, he said: “We require a holistic and need-based approach for crop nutrient applications. Farmers usually opt for indiscriminate use of urea and DAP when the production is reduced. Instead attention should be given to widely deficient macro and micronutrients, like deficiency of zinc, boron, sulphur and other essential minerals.”

Elaborating on biochar, he said: “Crop residue of plants like cotton, pigeon pea and other plants which cannot be used as fodder or for any other purpose can be recycled either directly or through composting. By using futuristic technology, the biomass can be made into biochar, which will lead to long-term storage of carbon in soil and help in fixing the atmospheric carbon thus reducing the pollution as well as global warming induced climate change.”

“Profile sampling of long-term experiments found that carbon sequestration increased by 100 kg per ha per year with the improved practices of landform management, fertilisers and crop varieties over 45 years. It is enhanced by 300 kg per ha per year with addition of residue over nine years,” he added.

HYDERABAD: In a research finding that will be music to the ears of both environmentalists and the farmers, a team from the ICRISAT has come up with the ways to enhance soil carbon in the drylands where it is relatively less. Soil carbon is critical for crop yield as it helps in increasing plant nutrient reserves, available water for longer periods and also plays a crucial role in global carbon cycling through representing the largest pool of carbon. The result of a modelling study conducted by the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) team between 2020 and 2022 revealed that with the right combination of fertiliser, biochar and irrigation, the soil carbon can potentially be increased by as much as 300 per cent over 30 years in 13 districts of Odisha and Maharashtra, contributing to global efforts to combat climate change.googletag.cmd.push(function() {googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-8052921-2'); }); Speaking to TNIE, Dr Girish Chander, co-lead of the project who studied the carbon sequestration, said: “Soil carbon is an important soil property as it is closely related to crop yield and aids sustainability. Most of agricultural soils in drylands are low in carbon, and have the potential not only to reduce its own emissions, but also from other sectors as well to enhance the quality of soil and water resources.’’ “Contrary to popular belief, soil is a storehouse of carbon as it contains about 2,500 billion tonnes, whereas air and plants together consist of about 1,350 billion tonnes of carbon.

Hyderabad: Fluctuating weather conditions marked the Year 2022 in Hyderabad. The summer was comparatively less harsh while the monsoon arrived in a big way and mercury kept hopping to lower and higher ranges during the winter.

Though the year began with January recording the lowest minimum temperatures, the cold dissipated fast and February was a contrast and heat seared the city between March and May.

Years 2016 and 2017 were the hottest, with mercury leaping to 43 degrees Celsius and compared to them, this summer turned out to be moderate, as the highest maximum temperature recorded was around 42 degrees Celsius.

However, April saw unusual heat wave episodes with temperatures crossing 40 degree Celsius for ten days. The mercury touched 42 degrees Celsius on April 30.

Based on 2013-22 data, Uppal, Kapra, Qutubullapur, Serilingampally, Khairathabad, Shaikpet, Asifnagar, Bahadurpura, and Saidabad witnessed higher summer temperatures (>;45°C). In the remaining areas, the temperatures were <45°C.

The rain gods were extra generous towards the State capital this monsoon. It received excess rainfall of 742.9 mm against the average mark of 562.1 mm.

After light rains in June, the season started changing in July as the city received 125 per cent excess rainfall. The highest rainfall of the month was recorded between July 6 and 13. While August ended with deficit rainfall, September witnessed the highest rainfall over a decade.

On September 26, some parts recorded 9.1 to 12.7 cm of rainfall in just three hours. Mehdipatnam was worst affected by 11.25 cm. The earlier highest rainfall of 9 cm in 24 hours was recorded on September 6, 2017.

The monsoon’s exit was delayed for a week, finally withdrawing on October 22. During this period, Trimulgherry, one of the oldest suburbs, crossed the monthly average on October 12 in just three hours. It usually sees rain of 107.7 mm in October, while the total rainfall that day reached 122.8 mm.

According to the Telangana State Development Planning Society report, the number of wet spells and heavy rainfall events has increased over the last 18 years. The highest rainfall was observed over Patancheru, Ramachandrapuram, Alwal, Malkajgiri, Uppal, Balanagar, Qutubullapur, Trimulgherry, Secunderabad, and Musheerabad, it added.

Meanwhile, the city got an early taste of winter as mercury started dipping in late October. On October 24, the minimum temperature dropped to 14.9 degrees Celsius, the lowest in the last 54 years. The third lowest temperature of 15.1 degrees Celsius was recorded on October 26.

Rainfall during the Northeast monsoon season, which prevails between October and December, is usually highest in Hyderabad. But October and November ended up with sizable deficient rain. Last month, minimum temperatures dropped below 15 degrees Celsius.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/hyd1.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/hyderabad-witnesses-changing-weather-patterns-in-2022

The Green Revolution of the 1960s pulled India from the brink of starvation, transformed the country’s ability to feed itself and turned it into a big food exporter. But the revolution also made India the world’s biggest extractor of groundwater.

According to the UN’s World Water Development Report, 2022, the country extracts 251 cubic km or more than a quarter of the world’s groundwater withdrawal each year; 90 per cent of this water is used for agriculture.

The gains are also tailing off; a 2019 study by the Indian Institute of Technology, Delhi, shows that over 39 million hectares (ha) of area in the country under wheat, rice and maize has not shown improvement in the past decade.

If agriculture is to continue to feed the country’s undernourished population — 224.5 million, according to the UN’s State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World, 2022 — and drive its economy, it needs to work in harmony with nature, not against it.

Farmers, activists and agricultural research organisations across the world are thus developing methods of chemical-less farming which uses natural inputs and cultivation practices such as crop rotation and diversification, which fall under the wider umbrella of regenerative agriculture.

This farming practice goes a step ahead of sustainable agriculture and aspires not only to maintain the resources like soil and water but also to improve them.

According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, healthy soil helps in better water storage, transmission, filtering and reduces agricultural run-off.

The key to improving water use and efficiency is enhancing the health and nutrient-holding capacity of the soil. Studies have established that one per cent increase in soil organic matter (an indicator of soil health) per 0.4 ha increases water storage potential by more than 75,000 litres.

In India, the Union government is promoting regenerative agriculture with an aim to reduce application of chemical fertilisers and pesticides and to lower input costs. States like Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh, Sikkim and Gujarat too have introduced schemes to promote it.

But can this approach also help alleviate the country’s water crisis, given that India’s soil health is highly degraded? A 2022 report by Delhi-based think tank Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), State of Bio Fertilizers and Organic Fertilizers in India, shows severe and widespread deficiency of organic carbon and micronutrients in Indian soils.

Researchers with CSE spoke to scientists and farmers to explore the benefits of regenerative agriculture for soil and subsequently water availability. They have found ample anecdotal evidence establishing the link, but say that concerted research is required to understand the role of regenerative agriculture in saving water.

The scientific findings will further help inform policy measures and future initiatives.

Cornucopia recast

Dinesh Kumar, principal scientist at the Indian Council for Agricultural Research-Indian Agriculture Research Institute (ICAR-IARI), Delhi, who specialises in organic farming, said: “Even if all other agricultural conditions are kept constant, organic farming helps improve soil structure and its organic content.”

Regenerative agricultural practices include use of natural inputs, minimum-till, mulching, multi-cropping and sowing of diverse and native varieties. In principle, natural inputs help improve soil structure and its organic carbon content, while planting water-guzzling and water-efficient crops together or in alternating cycles reduces the frequency and intensity of irrigation. They conserve energy used by irrigation aids such as pumps.

ICAR-IARI and other agricultural institutes have conducted multiple studies to show that these and other practices often followed by organic farmers like systematic rice intensification — a method in which seeds are spaced at wider distances and organic manure is applied to improve yields — changing crop system patterns, leaving residue on the field and micro-irrigation lead to better water conservation.

However, so far, there have been no structured studies on the water-saving potential of regenerative agriculture. The National Project on Organic Farming is the country’s longest experiment on the practice, ongoing since 2004 and conducted by ICAR-Indian Institute of Farming System Research, Meerut.

Even this does not measure water efficiency. The Central Arid Zone Research Institute, Jodhpur, has recently begun a study on this subject, said Arun Sharma, scientist, organic farming at the institution, but data will not be available for three or four years.

Evidence on the field

On the ground level, there have been some analyses which reaffirm the links among regenerative agriculture, soil health and water saving. Kheti Virasat Mission, a civil society organisation that works in Punjab, conducted in 2021-22 a survey of more than 350 organic farmers in the state.

Of the surveyed farmers, 93.6 per cent claim that the rainwater-holding capacity of their land increased compared to chemical-based farming. Organic farming reduced the irrigation requirements by 30-60 per cent in most cases.

Rythu Sadhikara Samstha, a non-profit set up by the Andhra Pradesh government to promote natural farming, conducted two studies in 2020 in the state —one on water consumption and the other on energy consumption — comparing results of zero-budget natural farming against chemical farming.

Zero-budget natural farming, now known as Subhash Palekar Natural Farming, emphasises on preparing and using inputs made from crop residue, cow dung and urine, fruits, among other things. The studies show irrigation frequency and energy consumption in natural farming decreases over time.

Samaj Pragati Sahyog, a grassroots organisation in Madhya Pradesh that promotes natural methods to control agricultural pests such as composting and recycling of crop residues, use of farm yard manure, cattle urine and application of tank silt, has also made efforts to this end.

It has conducted field trials with 1,000 farmers on more than 2,000 ha of land in four districts of Madhya Pradesh and one district of Maharashtra in 2016-18, to measure the water saved.

Its results, published in its annual report for 2018-19, show a total of almost 15 billion litres of water, by employing sustainable agriculture practices like changing crop systems, soil fertility interventions and micro-irrigation technologies.

Replacing water-guzzling crops like wheat, paddy and sugarcane with less water-intensive crops like gram or chickpeas alone saved 5.53 billion litres.

To put these numbers in perspective, as per the Union Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs, the benchmark for urban and rural water supply is 135 litres and 55 litres per capita per day, respectively.

This means 15 billion litres of water helps more than 110 million urban and 270 million rural people.

CSE also spoke to the farmers who were part of the trial. Mangilal Rathore, a farmer in Udainagar village, Dewas district, Madhya Pradesh, said, “Earlier we used to run our pump for four hours to flood-irrigate our land, now we run it for one hour. Also, the number of times irrigation is done has reduced for most of the crops.”

Yashoda Bai from Dad village, Dhar district, added, “We do not need to water our field before sowing. We take up rabi crops, which we did not earlier.”

This evidence, although compelling, needs to be backed by scientific studies. ICAR-IARI’s Kumar explained that there are multiple ways to calculate how much water is saved.

“For scientific studies the simplest method is by preparing three-four agricultural plots and irrigating them at different depths. The frequency of irrigation is determined on the basis of the evapotranspiration (transference of water from soil and plants to the atmosphere) of the crop. At the end of the crop cycle, water efficiency is calculated by dividing yield from plots by evapotranspiration. As we know which plot has been given how many units of water, we can calculate how much water is saved.”

Civil society organisations and farmers do not have the capacity to conduct long-term studies.

“Scientific bodies are best equipped to do such trials and calculations,” said Dinesh Balam, associate director of Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (WASSAN), a Hyderabad-based non-profit that works to conserve ecological resources. Such research will go a long way in promoting regenerative agriculture.

Asymmetric development reflected in the steep decline in the share of Indian agriculture from 52% of the GDP in 1951 to about 18% in 2022 despite agriculture accounting for about 55% of total employment. This impacts both economic growth and distributive equity.

Holistic Development: How?

Holistically transforming consumption patterns, shifting agricultural practices from sowing to planting, drainage, irrigation, fertilizer, plant protection, harvesting, weeding and storage, diversifying agriculture from foodgrains to high-value items, such as horticulture, livestock, fisheries, and truly sustainable better livelihoods are necessary. Widely acceptable benchmarks developed by Lead Banks and Nabard can be used to assess verifiable quantifiable indicators.

Attention to timeliness, adequacy, security and cost of credit and convergence of BC-based financial inclusion initiatives with the SHG network and macro-level demonstration of banking technologies is needed. Other measures include enhancing productivity of crops and animal husbandry, checking soil erosion and promoting watershed development and a trans-disciplinary approach. Community participation will make groundwater management more effective with wider ownership and deliver longer term regionally sustainable groundwater.

Greater financial inclusion by developing aspirational districts, microfinance, sanction and disbursement of higher credit by banks and financial institutions, formation of Joint Liability Groups and their credit linkage and monitoring and evaluation of verifiable quantifiable indicators and accent on Farmers Producers Organisations will be useful. With record foodgrain production, horticulture diversification, greater significance of allied sectors and changing dynamics of agriculture trade, the key enablers, viz, productivity, mechanisation and irrigation, need strengthening.

The RBI has highlighted agricultural challenges of climate change, agriculture waste management, disguised unemployment and volatile food prices necessitating supply-side interventions like higher public investment, storage infra and food processing industries.

Food Prices

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) shows a rise in food prices by 75% post-mid-2020. The CPI reveals doubling of rural consumer food prices in FY22 because of the Ukraine war, rising rural costs, which include food production and transport. The food sector is interconnected and interdependent.

The IMF stresses countries should allow hikes in food and fuel prices to pass through to domestic prices since food prices make up 44% of consumption in low-income countries, 28% in emerging market economies and 16% in advanced economies without being oblivious to the needs of vulnerable sections. IMF’s study in Sub-Sahara Africa shows external factors drive food price inflation but domestic factors can reduce their impact through monetary and fiscal policy, overall economic environment and transport constraint.

Transcending Credit

Agricultural credit disbursement rose from Rs 64,000 crore in FY2002 to Rs 17.09 lakh crore in FY22. While credit must grow quantitatively and qualitatively, streamlining credit requires a differentiated needs-based approach, thrust on FPOs to enhance credit and direct credit to desired channels, horticulture and value chain financing. Sweeping changes in cooperatives are reflected in the computerisation of about 63,000 functional Primary Agricultural Credit Societies (PACS) with a budget of Rs 2,516 crore (GoI Rs 1,528 crore) to raise the number of PACS to 3 lakh by 2025 and benefit 13 crore farmers.

Agricultural exports rose 20% to $50 billion in FY22 because of production, familiarising State governments and farmers in exports, removing infrastructural, logistics, post-harvest bottlenecks, new markets, greater share in existing markets, reduced transport costs and quality losses, use of refrigerated rail containers and modified tariff structure.

The Centre’s 2018 Agri Export Policy visualised robust agriculture, eg, doubling of exports from $30 billion to $60 billion by 2022, diversified exports, and boosting high value and value-added agricultural exports, non-traditional agri products promotion, greater market access and global integration.

Roadmap

Despite significant State-wide differences because of historical factors, agro-climatic conditions and opportunities for alternative productive employment, stress on KCC/Rupay KCC, crop insurance, land records digitisation and creation of charge, close coordination between the Revenue Department and State Level Banker’s Committee for registration of property rights, stress on balanced/integrated farming and complete knowledge about crops, agro-climatic conditions and market conditions to optimise production and remunerative prices to farmers will help.

Most parts of India have ample sunlight; hence focus on solar power/farms is imperative. There are also aspects such as drip/sprinkler irrigation, hi-tech nursery to promote fruits, vegetables and flowers. Another innovative strategy could be agri-tourism, which is a kind of multi-functionality involving various agricultural activities, animal rides and stay at rural areas with natural and fresh cuisines. Important location-specific criteria include proximate water source, away from polluted environment, better connectivity, natural site, historical importance.

Lack of credit facilities, water resources, specific policy and unclear tax exemption hamper agri-tourism. Given the huge latent potential, focus on site, infrastructure, marketing and displaying agri-tourism products and services is needed. Vocational training and focus on meeting the challenges of first generation women at micro-level business startups will promote women empowerment. Simultaneously, concerted attempts are necessary for greater investment and private participation.

Given the success in semi-arid regions, eg, north Rajasthan, community-based groundwater and ecosystem restoration could check ecological and socioeconomic decline. Locally appropriate, integrated social and technical solutions promote a virtuous cycle enhancing the quality of ecosystems and well-being of the people with effective use of STEEP (social, technological, economic, environmental, political) framework.

The roadmap must bring about a paradigm shift with an emphasis on competitiveness, pricing, quality, diversification, food parks and cold chain infrastructure, value-addition and moving up the value chain. This requires coordinated strategic and operational measures. Strategic action includes policy measures, infrastructure and logistics support, holistic export-oriented approach and greater engagement of State governments. Operationally, undivided attention on cluster-based approach, value-added exports, marketing and promotion of ‘Brand India’, strong quality control and evaluation mechanisms, research and development is needed.

In this vision of ‘a new India’— an India, which is fully developed, inclusive and equitable, agriculture and food exports require synchronised measures by the Centre, State governments, Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority, National Dairy Development Board, Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, exporters, food and agro-processing industry, RBI, Nabard, Exim Bank, banks, agri startups, FPOs/FPCs, apart from farmers themselves.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/op-2.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-raising-agriculture-food-exports

The founder claims that the climate projects not only work to address global issues but also to improve the standard of living.
In April, TRST01 launched Bhu, a carbon offset NFT token, and Arka, a solar offset NFT token.","In the race to combat the climate crisis, many countries have pledged to go carbon neutral. But that’s easier said than done. One of the major concerns is to implement green initiatives while maintaining the necessary agricultural and industrial output.





Numerous companies—Citi and IBM, among others—believe carbon offsetting and trading could provide a solution, where corporations eliminate their CO2 emissions by investing in carbon offset projects or attempt to remove carbon dioxide by planting trees and preserving forest creating offsets or credits.





These savings—or credits—can then be purchased by another individual or company, allowing them the right to produce a certain amount of carbon emissions. Each credit equals one tonne of carbon.





But the existing carbon market is perceived to be opaque, unorganised, and exclusive to big corporations, making it challenging for farmers, rural communities, and other people from lower socioeconomic levels to engage in this trade.





Since the market for carbon credits is so poorly regulated, dealers could also make dubious claims of carbon offsetting without implementation. But the global market for carbon offsets display no sign of slowing down, and is projected to be worth $35 billion by 2030.





Numerous blockchain startups have entered the space, looking for ways to reduce carbon emissions through NFTs. Recently, Polygon partnered with Klima DAO, which offers tokenised carbon credits. Other popular startups FlowCarbon, Moss, and Offsetra also created a buzz around the same.





Closer home, Web3 enthusiasts and investment bankers Prabir Mishra, Suraj Teja, and Puru Modani wanted to solve the lack of transparency in the carbon trading market while democratising access.





The trio launched TrayamBhu Tech Solutions (﻿TRST01﻿) in 2019, a blockchain platform digitising carbon credits to make the market more accessible to all.

In a conversation with The Decrypting Story, Prabir says, “With blockchain technology, all the data is on-chain, traceable, and transparent, and we believe this could play a significant role in solving for climate action and agriculture.""

However, the startup began by setting out to address food traceability using blockchain. “We tried to solve the issue by tracing the location of product and the date and time of the process through geo-fencing and geo-location. The certificates issued for these products are uploaded on the blockchain with embedded QR codes and anyone could trace the products. Next, we decided to focus on climate and agriculture projects,” he adds.

Climate action through NFT tokens

TRST01’s three tenets are trust, transparency, and traceability. In April, TRST01 launched Bhu, a carbon offset NFT token, and Arka, a solar offset NFT token. The startup has also tied up with RubiX, a green blockchain protocol, as its technology partner for the same.

“In an effort to raise public awareness of the climate crisis, we are enabling the common man to buy and offset and contribute to climate action,” says Prabir.

The NFT tokens are currently available on several marketplaces, including OpenSea and Rarible and will be available on JupiterMeta in future.





""We do not interact directly with farmers or communities. Instead, we connect with project developers and aggregators, who work across a wide range of projects involving solar energy, hydropower, the reduction of methane gas, and others. After the projects are completed, carbon credits are produced, and farmers, rural women, residents, or small communities that the developer worked with receive the benefits,"" he claims.





One of the initiatives the startup worked is a solar project in Himachal Pradesh. It tied up with the developer of three solar plants—Dhar, Bhandari Ram, and Sankhyan—that replaced conventional fossil fuel-based plants in the area, generating 1.5MW of clean and renewable energy.





The carbon credits from the solar project were digitised into NFTs and sold at $10 per credit on NFT marketplaces. The income generated will be distributed among villagers and women the project developer worked with. The startup has sold 500 NFTs to date.





The founder claims that the climate projects not only work to address global issues but also to improve the standard of living. “Most of our projects have generated monetary income for farmers. For instance, our partner project developers track around 40,000 hectares of forest land and aim to reduce methane gas. Each hectare may generate 3-5 carbon credits. The total may go up to 100k-200k carbon credits. The farmers will get around Rs 1,500- 2,000 per acre. Carbon credits generated from the reduction of methane gas are digitised as Bhu NFT tokens.”





At present, the startup has a team of 35 members.

In April, TRST01 launched Bhu, a carbon offset NFT token, and Arka, a solar offset NFT token.

BaaS

The startup follows Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) model, allowing buyers to build applications and digital services on a distributed network while it supplies the infrastructure and blockchain building tools. Its clients include corporations, governments, and other organisations building green projects.





It clocked total revenue of Rs 50 lakh in the last one year.





“In the first project, we provided blockchain solution for PDS (public distribution system) traceability to Government of Orissa and we were paid Rs 5 lakh for it. It was implemented through CSM Technologies, Bhubaneswar,” says Prabir.





In future, the startup aims to expand its operations in the US. “Currently, we are working on 8-10 projects and have over 15 clients on board,” says Prabir.





The startup is also in talks to work on several governmental projects. The co-founder says, “We are discussing with Himachal Pradesh state government to collaborate for a climate project and also partnering with Haryana state government on food traceability through STPI (software technology parks of India).”





TRST01 also aims to collaborate with the likes of Coromandel Agrico Group and Green Irrigation, among others for its agricultural and seed traceability projects.

The farmers, who had cultivated paddy during Vanakalam, are being encouraged to sow maize or jowar or sunflower without tilling the land.

Sangareddy: Trying out different and innovative practices to ensure that farmers derive the maximum profit from their farm fields, a few enthusiastic agriculture officers in the erstwhile Medak district are encouraging farmers to go for zero tillage cultivation during the Yasangi season this year.

The farmers, who had cultivated paddy during Vanakalam, are being encouraged to sow maize or jowar or sunflower without tilling the land.

One of the farmers, Reddy Lakshman had got a good yield by sowing maize on two acres at Thadkal village of Kangit Mandal in Sangareddy last year. This year, following his path, his brothers and cousins, who have their fields close by, Reddy Maruthi, Reddy Sahadev and others, have also opted for zero tillage cultivation of maize.

Speaking to Telangana Today, Agriculture Extension Officer of Thadkal cluster, Gandla Santosh, said the farmers in his cluster had saved Rs 4,000 on each acre by opting for the zero tillage model, which eventually improved their profit at the end. According to Santosh, after seeing neighbouring farmers reaping benefits, farmers in as many as 50 acres had cultivated maize and jowar in the Thadkal cluster. Apart from here, farmers in Kalher Mandal of Sangareddy had cultivated jowar on 30 acres of land in different villages.

Meanwhile, in Siddipet district, farmers in Narayanraopet Mandal too opted for zero tillage cultivation on 30 acres. AEO (Narayanraopet) T Nagarjuna said farmer Mogula Venkatesh of Lakshmidevipally under his cluster had cultivated maize without tilling his land last year. Venkatesh had got 31 quintals of harvest, which was equal to the normal yield.

According to Nagarjuna, the paddy stubble would provide natural organic carbon to the maize crop, which would eventually help to increase the yield. The troubles that come along with the practice of stubble burning could also be done away with zero tillage cultivation. While Venkatesh was continuing zero tillage cultivation, a few other farmers were now following in his footsteps, Nagarjuna said.

Hyderabad: The Ministry of Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Government of India and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), have on Thursday announced the launch of a new programme, “Trees Outside Forests in India.”

The programme will expand tree coverage outside of forest lands to enhance carbon sequestration, support local communities, and strengthen the climate resilience of agriculture, thereby supporting global climate change mitigation and adaptation goals, according to an official press release.

The new $25 million programme will bring together farmers, companies and private institutions in India to rapidly expand tree coverage outside of traditional forests by 28 lakh hectares. Through agroforestry, or integrating trees into farming systems, the programme will improve the resilience of farming systems while increasing the income of farmers. The programme will also use innovative financing models and leverage India’s private sector to promote tree-based enterprises, helping to create sustainable markets and improve rural economies and livelihoods, with the potential to benefit more than 13 million people, the release said.

Implemented by a consortium led by the Centre for International Forestry Research (CIFOR) and World Agroforestry (ICRAF), the programme will be implemented in seven states including Andhra Pradesh, Assam, Haryana, Odisha, Rajasthan, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh.

Announcing the launch, the Secretary for Environment, Forest, and Climate Change, Leena Nandan, said, “India and the U.S. are firmly committed to working closely in many areas including the forestry sector. At the global level, India is playing a prominent role in forming and shaping affirmative responses to the challenges faced by the forest and environment sector. India has undertaken rapid economic growth while successfully conserving and enhancing its forest resources and would continue to do so through strategic planning and focused implementation.”

Highlighting the U.S.-India cooperation on climate change and forestry, the U.S. Chargé d’Affaires Patricia A. Lacina, said, “As one of the world’s largest economies and a global leader in science and innovation, India plays a critical role in helping solve the climate crisis. This new programme builds on the enduring U.S.-India partnership to tackle the climate crisis by enhancing carbon sequestration and bolstering resilience in the face of climate threats. India’s achievements on these issues can provide models for the world.”

USAID’s forestry activities in India support important priorities of the U.S. and Indian governments, contributing to the Forestry Pillar of the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue in support of the U.S.-India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 Partnership. This new programme builds on the enduring U.S.-India partnership to tackle the climate crisis and bolster resilience in the face of climate threats and extreme weather events, the release added.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/India-US-launch-new-initiative-to-increase-tree-coverage-in-India.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/india-us-launch-new-initiative-to-increase-tree-coverage-in-india

In addition to the risk to human lives and damage to property, climate change has implications on food security as the immediate impact of climate change is on food production and its prices.
Agriculture — which accounts for about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP) and 43% of employment—is the most vulnerable to climate change.
According to CRISIL, climate change is primarily a fiscal challenge for the governments.
Policymakers not only need to work together to reduce long-term effects of climate change, but also need to respond to the short-term effects of climate change on the economy,"" the rating agency concludes.","Calling India one of the countries in Asia most vulnerable to the physical risks of climate change, CRISIL Ratings says the damage from climate change, especially to agriculture, is already visible. Multiplying extreme events magnify the vulnerabilities of agriculture in India and, in the short term, the Union government's climate action response should also more sharply focus on mitigating risks to the agriculture sector, it added.

In a report, the rating agency says, ""While the government cannot control the physical climate risks to the sector, it can speed up other efficiency improvements, such as reducing crop wastage, improving irrigation, setting up warehousing facilities, and promoting research, development and introduction of weather-resilient, high yielding varieties of crops. Promoting investment in food processing and cold storage to reduce food wastage is another option that can help reduce losses.""

According to CRISIL, India's problem is also unique, given its high reliance on agriculture for employment and output, repeated struggles with controlling food price inflation, high reliance on fossil fuel for power, high emission intensity of industrial production and limited fiscal space to react and/or respond to climate change.

An analysis by the United Nations (UN) intergovernmental panel on climate change (IPCC) indicates agriculture in India will come under more significant pressure from increased frequency of heatwaves, more rainfall extremes, more frequent dry spells and extreme rainfall, water scarcity, and soil degradation.

This year has been a wake-up call for India, as well as for others in the sub-continent and other parts of the world hit by intense heatwaves, erratic rains, floods, droughts, storms and cyclones causing wide-spread damage to life and property.

In India, heatwaves pre-monsoon, patchy progress of rainfall during the monsoon, and excess rainfall post-monsoon have impacted several agricultural crops and swayed food inflation.

This year, CRISIL says, the unanticipated rise in food inflation has been a concern. ""Elevated global food prices amid supply shortages and input cost pressures due to the Russia-Ukraine war initially played spoilsport, but closer to home — truant weather aggravated pressure on domestic prices.""

""Full-year agriculture growth does not face much downside as rabi prospects appear bright, thanks to good soil moisture content and healthy reservoir levels. Yet, patchy rainfall during the southwest monsoon resulted in lower kharif sowing, especially for rice and pulses, while unusually high October rains led to some crop damage, leading to higher prices of foodgrains, fruits and vegetables,"" it added.

In India, changing monsoon patterns and rising frequency of extreme weather events could largely be explained as offshoots of climate change. This highlights a bigger concern around the need to assess climate shocks and the impact on the Indian economy.

Though there are learnings from other countries, which are first movers attempting to mitigate the impact of climate change, India's problem is also unique.

According to CRISIL, a key risk to agriculture is the damage from unseasonal rain and heat patterns to foodgrains, vegetables and other crops.

""Such weather shocks have become more frequent, intense, and worryingly, remain unpredictable. For instance, October this year was one of the wettest in recent years at the all-India level. The unevenness or lack of predictability of weather conditions highlights a bigger concern about the need to assess climate shocks and the impact on the agricultural economy. This is especially important in a 46% rain-fed, agriculture-dependent country like India,"" the report says.

While parts of east and north-east India, including Bihar, Jharkhand, West Bengal, Manipur, Tripura and Uttar Pradesh in northwest India, received consistently poor rainfall, others in the central part, like Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra and southern India, such as Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Karnataka, and Kerala had excess rainfall for the entire season.

For the southwest monsoon season, out of the 36 sub-divisions, only 18 received normal rainfall, with 12 receiving excess rainfall and six deficient. The chart below shows the variation in rainfall activity at the regional level.

According to CRISIL, uneven rains put pressure on agri output and keep inflation elevated. ""Preliminary estimates suggest a likely hit to rice production by 6%-7%. Pulses, which saw lower acreage this year, because of some shift to oilseeds which became more lucrative, was also affected by excess rains. This has immediately impacted inflation in these two segments. Compared with a 0.4% on-month rise in overall consumer price index (CPI) food inflation during August-September, cereals and pulses saw larger increase of 2.2% and 1.3% on-month, respectively. Wheat inflation is already in double digits, thanks to the heat wave in the early part of this year.""

Not only are rainfall patterns undergoing changes, but extreme weather events, in general, also seem to be on the rise, largely as a result of climate change, the rating agency says.

For instance, according to the Indian meteorological division (IMD), March this year was India's hottest in recorded history between 1901-2022. Temperatures were high across India, especially in the northwest which saw a scorching heat wave. The average maximum temperature over northwest and central India in April this year has also been the highest in 122 years.

Last year, India experienced five cyclones, three of which were 'severe' and higher in intensity.

""It is worrying that — according to the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (CRI), which is based on extreme weather events, such as storms, floods, and heatwaves in a particular year — India is one of the most vulnerable countries for the extreme weather events. Compared with 31 in 2010, India ranked 7 on CRI in 2019. In fact, India has been ranked in top 20 in almost all the years in the past three decades,"" the rating agency says.

In addition to the risk to human lives and damage to property, climate change has implications on food security as the immediate impact of climate change is on food production and its prices.

Agriculture — which accounts for about 15% of India's gross domestic product (GDP) and 43% of employment—is the most vulnerable to climate change. Frequent heatwaves, extreme rainfalls, water scarcity and soil degradation directly impact the agriculture output and incomes in India. Decreased output, in turn, results in weaker rural income and, consequently, lower demand. Heatwaves also reduce labour productivity, the report says.

According to CRISIL, climate change is primarily a fiscal challenge for the governments. ""At a broader level, going beyond agriculture, the government should encourage move to cleaner technologies and clean technology industries through targeted tax incentives.""

In addition, given its inflation-targeting mandate, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI's) monetary policy committee (MPC) will also have to take heed of the increasing role of climate change-led weather disturbances in influencing consumer price inflation.

""As inflation faces upside risks and higher volatility due to climate change, there is a greater need to maintain credible monetary policy, to keep inflation expectations under control. Policymakers not only need to work together to reduce long-term effects of climate change, but also need to respond to the short-term effects of climate change on the economy,"" the rating agency concludes.",https://www.moneylife.in/media/uploads/article/responsive/CRISILbig24nov2022.jpg,[],https://www.moneylife.in/article/indian-agriculture-is-most-vulnerable-to-physical-risks-of-climate-change-crisil/68994.html

The political fragmentation and the rise of regional political parties has been one of the most important trends in India’s electoral politics in the last few decades. The regional parties that were marginal players on the national scene helped form national governments in 2004 and 2009.

Common Problem

Regionalism is no longer viewed as a negation of nationalism or nation-building. Leaders of the regional parties have started playing an active, and even deterministic, role in the organisation of the Central government. Again, momentum is picking up to unite regional parties and their combined strength may force national parties to forge alliances with them. Recent meetings between regional party leaders have been focusing on leadership. While leadership is important, it is policies, programmes, institutions and people’s participation that is critical to attracting and bringing people together.

What is required is not mere fronts and alliances but a renewed commitment to common problems. Only common issues can bring regional parties onto a platform and one such is agriculture, because government policies, both under UPA and NDA regimes, not only neglected agriculture with a lack of will to stand with farmers but also played an active role in deepening the crisis. The farmer has reached the brink of despair, and what they are experiencing is something which is beyond an agrarian crisis. Agrarian and rural dissent can be politically challenging and elections in five States in 2018 reminded parties of how dissatisfied farmers could derail all electoral calculations.

India continues to be a predominantly agriculture-based economy with over 60% of the population still dependent on the sector. Thus, the community’s disenchantment with any party can be a serious cause for concern. Over 300 seats of the 543 seats in the Lok Sabha are from rural areas. The link between agriculture and elections was visible in some States and the agricultural crisis was touted as one of the main reasons for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party’s loss in Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan. Regional parties opposing the BJP can use this opportunity to reinvent themselves, incorporating the lessons learned from healthy regional parties, such as the need to build durable, agile organisational structures.

Reforms Must

Indian farming desperately needs reforms. Agriculture in the country is confronted with high price volatility, climate risks and indebtedness. As 86% of the farmers are small and marginal with declining and fragmenting landholdings, these uncertainties make them even more vulnerable and risk-prone. A long-term solution to agrarian distress lies in improving farm productivity through a series of measures like mass irrigation programmes through the interlinking of rivers, diversification of agriculture and smart farming. In short term, a farm-centric economy and farmer-centric interventions should be the focus of regional parties to achieve global standards in productivity.

The three farm laws introduced last year appeared to be radical but without any support for the farmer during the transition period. They were also without building consensus with the States and were rammed and withdrawn without alternative steps. For farmers, there is no clarity on how the existing system will be improved, if and how the agricultural policy will evolve and whether we can expect a positive change under this government.

India’s diversity should prompt the regional parties to adopt a federal approach to agriculture and allow State governments to decide the course of action in their regions. It requires bringing the farmers of the country into consensus and discussing federal solutions for agriculture.

The Congress leadership despite having the resources, manpower and considerable vote base has failed to be an alternative to the BJP and its future seems bleak beyond doubt. It is proven that a weak Congress and disunited regional parties keep the BJP in power. The regional parties have brilliant thinkers, smart managers, crafty communicators, leaders with a solid mass base, and moneybags such as K Chandrashekhar Rao, Mamata Banerjee and Sharad Pawar. But these are individual leaders and political entrepreneurs. However, there is no person or process to gather it all together and turn it into a collective strength that could be deployed to save the republic.

Convincing Farmers

Since 2024 will be, by far, the most crucial election, beginning early to get all these factors right is indispensable for the regional parties. These parties can easily convince the farming communities and thus, retain a stronghold over these States for the upcoming elections. The regional parties that are in power in different States need to work on building their own distinctive model of governance by putting forth the work that was done in States like Telangana.

The unity of the farmers that is essential for leaders of regional parties cannot be achieved automatically but with long-term relationship building, historically shared struggles, and concrete work to identify shared and common agendas in farming. This requires building broader movements and continuing cooperation between the farmer organisations.

Chandrashekhar Rao has the experience and track record to fundamentally change the agricultural model of India and catapult it into economic prosperity if the political climate at the national level enables this positive change. Under the circumstances, Rao highlighting farming issues to unify regional parties and exposing national parties which protect their power and privilege in the garb of democracy, secularism, and social justice, is a welcome step in a vibrant democracy.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Agriculture.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-agriculture-can-enable-regional-unity

Further Development:

The state IT Minister K. Tarakarama Rao has assured the start-up of complete support for establishing the facility to design, manufacture, and test rockets in the state. He participated in a programme organized at T-Hub to celebrate Skyroot Aerospace’s successful launch of the Vikram-S rocket.

About The Skyroot:

The Hyderabad-based startup, incubated at T-Hub, launched the country’s first private rocket. Skyroot Aerospace became the first privately held company in India after the space sector was opened for the private players by the union government in 2020.

Skyroot Aerospace wants to build high-technology, low-cost, reliable launch vehicles. Its co-founders Chandana and Naga Bharath Daka previously worked with the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as rocket scientists for about a handful of years before starting up in 2018.

The Minister expressed pride and happiness that a spacetech company from Hyderabad, broke all the barriers. He said only a few companies across the world aced rocket science and achieved success in the first go.

India & Space Economy:

The global space economy is valued at just over $450 billion, out of which India’s share is roughly about 2 per cent. The key to increasing India’s contribution to the global space output lies with the private sector.

The government of India opened the space sector to private enterprises and made room for sharing ISRO know-how and infrastructure with private players.

In 2021, Skyroot formally signed up with ISRO. By entering into an agreement with the Department of Space on 2 February, it secured access to ISRO’s facilities and technical expertise as they went about developing their launch vehicles. Over a year later, in June 2022, the Hyderabad-based startup signed an agreement (MoU) with the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe), which enabled the launch of its rockets from the ISRO spaceport.

A bench headed by Justice Adarsh ​​Kumar Goel imposed the environmental penalty on the Telangana government October 1, 2022.

The amount of the penalty was decided on the basis of an earlier judgment by the Supreme Court September 2, 2014 in Almitra Patel case and February 22, 2017 Paryavaran Suraksha vs. Union of India case.

The tribunal also followed the ‘polluter pays’ principle under Section 20 of the NGT Act, the order said. It referred to its September 1, 2022 order in the West Bengal case regarding the amount of the penalty imposed.

The compensation for untreated liquid waste was determined to be Rs 2 crore per million litres per day (MLD) and Rs 300 per tonne for unprocessed legacy waste. Thus, the bench imposed Rs 3,648 crore on Telangana for untreated 1,824 MLD sewage.

It also fined the state government Rs 177 crore for non-treatment of 5.9 million tonnes of legacy waste by 141 urban local bodies — totalling the penalty to Rs 3,800 crore.

The bench calculated 5.9 million tonnes of legacy waste on the basis of disposal of 2,446 tonnes per day waste of 114 municipal bodies. It also noted that the Greater Hyderabad Municipal Corporation (GHMC) had dumped 1.2 million tonnes of legacy waste at the Jawaharnagar dump site, which is against the norms of the Central Pollution Control Board.

The Telangana government did not take NGT directions ‘seriously’ and there was no ‘adequate compliance’ even after three years, the bench said. The government had not fixed any accountability, collected any fines or carried out any performance audits, it added.

The state government was directed to deposit the fine amount in two different accounts within the next two months. The Chief Secretary of the state will use the penalty amount to restore the damage to the environment, the tribunal directed.

The state was also directed to file a progress report with the NGT every six months. The Chief Secretary will take restoration steps at the earliest, the NGT said.

The Governor implicitly but sharply assailed the BRS government, asserting that Telangana's ""stressful"" conditions were evidenced by the growing suicide rate and that everyone should have equal share in development.

Chief Minister K. Chandrashekar Rao and his Cabinet colleagues skipped the event, once again bringing to the fore the widening rift between Pragathi Bhavan and Raj Bhavan.

Drawing from Dr B.R. Ambedkar, the architect of the Constitution, who remarked that there must not be a class that has got all the privileges and a class that has got all the burdens to bear, the Governor noted, ""New buildings are not for development, nation-building is for development. Everyone should have equal share in development. It is not development to say I am sending my child abroad to study. Every child should study in universities with world-class infrastructure.”

Making it clear that she is not a person who got deterred by hurdles thrown at her, Dr Soundrarajan affirmed, “Some may not like me. But I like the people of Telangana. So, irrespective of how hard it gets, I will keep working” while stating that everyone should take pride in their contribution towards inclusive development of the state.

While pledging to defend and uphold Telangana's rights and democracy, she said, “Standing here on the holy soil of Telangana, I feel immensely honoured to unfurl the National Flag. In the development of the people of Telangana, my role will definitely be there. My big strength is hard work, honesty, and love. We will keep up the honour of Telangana. Let’s save democracy in Telangana. Let’s keep our rights. My connection to Telangana is not for three years but was there from my birth.”

She said the Republic Day was a reminder of the supremacy of the Constitution and that the ultimate power rested with the people. “The Republic empowers people to design the destiny of the country through their collective will. I am happy to note that Telangana was made possible through Article 3 of the Constitution. The state was formed after a 60 year relentless struggle exemplified by our Medaram warriors, the deities Samakka and Saralamma, Komram Bheem, Chakali Ailamma and countless others.”

Later answering questions from reporters at Puducherry, where she is the Lieutenant Governor, Dr Soundararajan said the Telangana government had deliberately not held the Republic Day celebrations at the Parade Ground in Secunderabad despite orders from the Telangana High Court to do so.

Republic Day events were not held at the Parade Ground for the past two years because of Covid but this year too the Telangana government had trotted out the Covid alibi, she said. “But they went ahead and held a public meeting with lakhs of people,” she said in reference to the recent BRS meeting in Khammam.

In addition to the heavy losses incurred by excess rainfall during monsoon months, farmers in the Marathwada region of Maharashtra are now forced to sell cotton at low price, eventually pushing them towards debt.

Over 3.2 million hectares of agricultural land, as well as more than 4.8 million farmers, have been affected by excess rainfall between June and October last year, the peak monsoon months, according to data from the Aurangabad divisional commissionerate.

Also read: Extreme rainfall damages nearly 4 million hectares of crops in Marathwada

The production was affected by excess and erratic rainfall. In some areas, snails also caused damage to crops. There is no individual crop data to assess the damage to cotton.

Kishor Tawar, a farmer owning seven acres of land in Paithan taluka of Aurangabad district, told Down to Earth:

Excess rainfall has caused a loss of about 50 per cent across the cotton belt region. I had grown cotton on four acres of irrigated land and managed to produce only 16 quintals against an expectation of 28 quintals.

The losses are incredibly high and the selling prices have dropped recently, impacting even the recovery of production costs in some cases, Tawar said.

“On an average a farmer has suffered a loss between two-five quintals per acre depending on land, soil and the amount of rainfall received,” he said.

Farmers will not be able to recover the production costs if the losses are high, he added.

The prices dropped from Rs 9,000 per quintal to Rs 6,000-Rs 6,500 per quintal this year, Tawar, who is also an activist with farmers’ body Shetkari Sanghatna.

“Earlier, the companies that procure cotton said the produce will elicit high demand and fetch good price, but the erratic weather has taken it all away,” he said.

Parmeshwar Gholap, a farmer with seven acres of land in Pachegaon of Beed district, said he produced 28 quintals of cotton, costing him Rs 1.30 lakh.

“The cost of chemical fertilisers and pesticides increased this year and the changing weather demanded more pest control measures,” he said.

Gholap said even if he fetches Rs 7,000 for a quintal, he will not even earn Rs 2 lakh. “I know the buyers will not buy at that price. How will I feed my family with Rs 40,000-50,000 for a year?” he asked.

The situation worsens every year. “Due to the same, farmers now think that the previous year was better than the current. The low price is demotivating the farmers,” Gholap said.

Rameshwar Gade, another farmer from the same village, said the central government’s interference is also to be blamed for the low cotton price.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India suspended cotton futures trading in the stock market in December. The suspension is for a year and it stopped potential investors from participating in cotton trading, which would have supported an increase in the production, he said.

The move would only benefit large textile companies, who can afford to buy cotton from farmers in bulk at a low cost, Gade said.

“Moreover, the cost of cotton per quintal ranges from Rs 9,000-Rs 12,000 in Maharashtra and neighbouring states like Telangana.

The rates are higher than international market by five per cent-10 per cent. In such a situation, the cotton export cost will have to be further reduced to encourage international buyers to procure from Indian farmers,” he added.

The overall situation is only worsening the state of cotton farmers, Gade said.

Real-estate expansion into common lands operates from a strong nexus between local power elites and local administration both belonging to the upper castes.

Social costs of industrialisation are pushed on to the villages, where the marginalised suffer the most.

The views in this commentary are that of the authors.

N. S. Jodha’s pioneering work on Commons in 1986 alerted us to the poor’s dependency on these resources. When the commons degrade, the poor suffers the most. However, we knew little about what happens when the resource is revived or conserved – who gets access to this and who gains from this? We also knew little then how the process of alienation happens beyond the so-called development projects shrinking the commons. Overall, the intricacies of caste and gender dimensions in the alienation process from commons continues to be an anecdotal narrative if not grossly missing. The caste dimension of power relations is intricate, leading to alienation on the one hand and grabbing and appropriation on the other. This can be seen in the Narva village in Telangana where our field study was conducted.

The village of Narva, prior to the creation of mandals (an administrative division) during 80s, was part of Chennur taluk. While being part of Chennur taluk, the revenue administration of Narva operated through the village Jaipur where the panchayat samiti (a rural local government body) was located and the sarpanch (head of the village government) resided. Village officers being designated as Patwari, Police Patel, Mali Patel also belonged to Jaipur village whereas village servants such as Sunkari and Neeredu were present even in the hamlets. The Police Patel had to deal with law and order, Mali Patel was responsible for collection of revenue and tehsi (tax), whereas Sunkari, served as an assistant to village officers and Neeredu was the irrigation overseer. Caste configuration of those who wielded positions of power in the village reveals that Velama and Kapu castes of the region were dominant. During a field trip to Narva, a village located right opposite Singareni Thermal Power Plant and adjacent to National Highway-63, in the Mancherial district of Telangana, the villagers assembled at the entrance of the village – a barren land to mourn the demise of their co-villager. As they gathered, discussions ensued with reference to an encroachment of culturable, uncultivated common land that fell on the route towards the cremation site. With the encroachment of this strip of land, villagers have to walk three times more in order to reach the cremation site. The villagers relate to this land as Mana Bhoomulu (our lands) and Mana thovva (our routes). The official record affirms their position, which reveals that land under commons was privatised in a non-transparent manner.

Appropriation of the commons

The nature of appropriation of commons historically represented a quest for conversion of pastures, forest lands and cultivable/uncultivable lands into agricultural lands. The pursuit of expansion of agriculture was driven by both state as well as individual households. States aimed at extracting revenue while the individuals who cleared land for agriculture aimed for subsistence and livelihood.

Narva was an independent village, which organised its own agriculture through clearing of lands and transforming them into cultivable lands. Owing to the structure of power vested with local chiefs, Doras and Patels, the best lands suitable for cultivation vampu-jaagalu where water flows easily, were usurped from the villagers of Narva, and were recorded against dominant castes. The spatial distribution in terms of ownership of lands by Scheduled Castes of Narva signifies this fact. A majority of land owned by them is aakasai/metta/ (sandy and loamy dry land), as against a major chunk of land adjacent to the village water tanks owned by dominant caste non-villagers. The current official record of land adjacent to Narva Pedda Cheruvu, a major tank, which irrigates about 88 acres of land reveals that the Scheduled Castes of Narva own only about 36% of the land, whereas a remaining 64% are owned by non-villager dominant castes.

The current appropriation of commons however, is driven by non-agrarian pursuits. A major phase of appropriation of commons for non-agricultural pursuits happened prior to 2018 when Narva was still a hamlet village under Mudikunta Panchayat. Encroachments of commons included uncultivated barren lands and lands designated to construct houses for houseless.

As narrated by villagers, when Narva was part of Mudikunta Panchayat, the Sarpanch of the village (a Yadav by caste) occupied the common lands and privatised the lands by transacting to a poultry breeding farm owned by a person who belongs to Kapu community. Similarly, the lands adjacent to the poultry farm which were reserved for construction of houses for homeless and were prohibited from transaction were also encroached by the dominant castes in power. As the villagers of Narva did not have access to the land records, they were kept in a state of ignorance. This was not the case with sarpanch and the Kapu member who had access to the Mandal revenue authorities at Jaipur and political leadership of that time, through which they converted de-jure status Commons into de-facto private property.

There are similar instances of lands owned by a Scheduled Caste households being encroached upon by people from dominant castes or with influence.

A power plant plan drives real estate

Real estate forecast at Narva has begun to boom immediately after the proposals to set up Singareni Thermal Power Plant during the year 2010 and the subsequent expansion of NH-63 from two-lane to four-lane. The first venture was set up in Narva and has encroached over an area of 8 acres having survey numbers 413 and 414, classified as Government Lands. This was further extended to another 8.175 acres of Government land having survey number 464. These survey numbers were meant for construction of houses for the homeless and were prohibited from transaction.

With the spike in prices for land, an upward expansion of real-estate ventures converting cultivable agrarian lands is happening at a rapid pace. In such processes of expansion, the canals which facilitate irrigation were diverted in order to convert the lands for non-agricultural purpose. Tanks known as Narva Peda Cheruvu, have Mathadi-kaluva or canals to irrigate the farthest-down fields. As the real-estate expansion began from the farthest-down fields and moved upwards, the Mathadi-kaluva in Narva was diverted. Real-estate ventures became a lucrative option for non-cultivating landowners who use to lease out land for agriculture. Now they sell the land for real-estate. Such process became problematic for cultivating owners and tenant cultivators. An upward expansion of real-estate towards the tank disturbs the regular channels of irrigation as large deposits of moram (red soil) poured on the agricultural lands for the purpose of leveling of the land for real-estate purpose. This results in market induced displacement for small owner cultivators to dispose of the land as water supply to their fields is disrupted with the canal disruption. The cultivating owners of Narva have a dissenting opinion on growing real-estate and encroachments, who fear the worst for market-induced displacement adversely affecting small-holders and tenant cultivators. Post creation of Narva as an independent panchayat, the issues related to encroachment of lands allotted to landless Dalits were represented to the officials from the rank of Mandal Revenue officer to district collector, yielding little or no response.

In the village of Narva, as agriculture continues to be the major mode of subsistence, the expansion of real-estate at the cost of agriculture induced a reduction in the number of days of employment for the landless agricultural labourers and adversely affecting tenant cultivators with the reduced land available in lease market. As long as agriculture remained to be a major occupation of subsistence and a source of revenue for the state, initiatives were taken up to construct tanks, post which the prime lands adjacent to the tanks remained sites of dominance by the powerful. The rights of original tiller and clearers of lands were forfeited through forceful enclosure and occupation of those lands through use of power and under the pretext of non-payment of Tehsil tax. The changing context of a rapid expansion of real-estate resulted in conversion of commons and agricultural lands for non-agricultural pursuits, as against the earlier forms of appropriation majorly for agrarian pursuits.

The villagers of Narva, thus, bear the brunt of both direct effects of pollution with ash released from the chimney of the plant, as well the indirect effects of the power plant which resulted in expansion of real-estates, conversion of agricultural lands into non-agricultural lands and commons grabbing adversely impacting the livelihoods of the poor and marginalised. The villagers perceive indirect effect of the plant to have more pronounced adverse impact on their livelihoods as compared with the direct effects of the establishment of the plant.

The expansion of industrial units of both mining and thermal plants might become necessary to provide to the needs of the state, however, such an objective of serving the interests of the state should not be at the expense of the local residents who bear the brunt of pollution and loss of livelihoods. An uncompromising compensatory framework of offering livelihood opportunities becomes necessary for the dispossession inflicted on the local marginalised communities.

It is critical for India too as it has to provide food to a large population of about 1.39 billion people. Punjab and Haryana continue to be the leading states in contributing to central pool stocks of food grains. The two states earned a lot of flak during the farmers’ agitation for demanding continuation of the existing system of APMCs and Minimum Support Price operations. Like the rabi marketing season, in the current kharif marketing season 2022-23 (October – September) also, the two states have provided comfort to the Union government.

Paddy crop 2022

Due to delayed monsoon and its erratic monthly spread, both area and yield of paddy may have suffered in many states.

At all India level, area under paddy was about 20 lakh hectares lower than last year (403 lakh hectares in 2022 as compared to 423 lakh hectares in 2021). The sown area was lower in Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.

Impact of erratic monsoon is likely to reduce rice production. As per the government’s first advance estimates, India’s kharif rice production is likely to be about seven million metric tonnes (MMTs) lower than last year. It was about 112 MMTs in 2021-22 and is estimated to be about 105 MMTs this year. India also produces rice in rabi season, but its (the season’s) contribution to the country’s annual rice production is only about 15 per cent. So, making up for this loss of production may not be possible.

Paddy procurement 2022

Lower production will also pull down procurement of rice. As of 10 November, 231.28 lakh metric tonnes of paddy has been procured. This will deliver about 154.9 LMT of rice (one quintal of paddy gives about 67 kg of rice). Last year, on this date, the procurement in terms of rice was 152.8 LMT.

In 2021-22, 43.91 LMT of rice was procured in UP. This year, the estimated procurement in the state is 40 LMT. Both east and west UP received lower rainfall, especially in July and August. By 2 September, the rainfall was deficient by 44 per cent in both east and west UP. Therefore, the paddy production is expected to be lower than last year. It is therefore rather unlikely that UP will be able to procure 40 LMT of rice.

Role of Haryana and Punjab

These two states have been at the forefront of India’s food security. This year also, their contribution is substantial.

As of 10 November, Haryana has procured 38.6 LMT of rice this kharif Marketing Season against last year’s 35.5 LMT. Punjab has procured 104.1 LMT, which is about 4.3 LMT less than 108.4 LMT procured last year. Taken together, the two states account for 92 per cent of rice procured so far.

The procurement of paddy in these two states is almost over by the end of November as the APMC system is strong and streamlined. In other states, where APMCs are not that effective, like UP and Bihar (APMCs do not exist), the arrival of paddy continues for several months beyond November.

It must be recalled that wheat production this year was adversely impacted due to unusually warm weather in March and April 2022. Government estimates still show the production at 106 Million MTs, while the trade estimates the wheat production between 95-100 Million MTs. Due to a smaller wheat crop, the government could not procure the required quantity of wheat this year. In fact, (i) the wheat procurement was only 187.9 LMT (Lakh Metric Tonnes), down from 433.4 LMT in the previous year; and (ii) wheat stocks in central pool are at their 14-year low levels. Punjab (96.45 LMT) and Haryana (41.86 LMT) were the most important contributors of wheat procured this year. The two states accounted for 73.6 per cent of wheat procured. Both Punjab and Haryana continue to play the role of dominant yet stable and consistent suppliers of these grains to the central pool.

During the Covid-19 pandemic, the government could provide additional food grains, free of cost, under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY) only due to the excessive procurement of wheat and rice in the previous four years.

Paddy/rice outlook 2022-23

With a lower kharif crop, will production of paddy in rabi crop be able to cover some of the production lost in kharif crop due to lower rainfall?

Paddy is grown in rabi crop season in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Telangana and West Bengal. Several state governments are pushing for diversification from paddy to less water-guzzling crops in kharif and rabi seasons. Haryana, Chhattisgarh, Telangana have taken lead in this direction and several incentives have been announced for farmers who move away from paddy to alternative crops. Chhattisgarh is offering assured procurement of arhar, moong and urad at MSP and has declared zero acreage for its upcoming rabi paddy crop. If these incentives are successful in reducing the area under rabi paddy, the production of rabi rice could be lower than normal.

Over-reliance on wheat and rice

Since the Public Distribution System is continuing in its present form and there is no roadmap to move to direct benefit transfer of food subsidy, the Union government will continue to depend on procurement of wheat and rice at MSP.

Many states, as mentioned before, are making efforts to encourage production and procurement of pulses like arhar, moong and urad. These states can undertake such procurement under the government’s Price Support Scheme (PSS) but they are only allowed to procure 25 per cent of their production. In case of nutri-cereals, they are required to distribute the procured quantity within their state. This is the reason for their reluctance to procure pulses, oilseeds and nutri-cereals, beyond the quantity permitted by the government under PSS. In the past, Nafed (National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation of India Ltd) was the nodal agency for procurement of pulses and oilseeds under PSS and it incurred losses.

Ideally, the market should support MSP for these crops so that procurement by the government agencies is not required but year after year we find that prices go below MSP during the peak arrival season.

Price incentives are critical for farmers and if these incentives continue to work only for rice and wheat, diversification to less water consuming crops will not be found attractive by the farmers. In the era of climate change, if Punjab and Haryana do not produce enough surplus of rice and wheat, the food security for basic staples itself may be under threat.

The Telangana State Pollution Control Board (TSPCB) has cracked the whip on illegal stone crusher units operating in Vattinagulapally, Kokapet, Gouldoddi, Gopanpally, Kollur, Kotwalguda and Osmannagar villages in Rangareddy and Sangareddy district of Telangana.

The board ordered the closure of 12 stone crushers and imposed an environmental compensation of Rs 5.46 crore on them in November, this year. The amount will be used for the restitution of the environment in accordance with Section 15 of the National Green Tribunal (NGT) Act, 2010.

The action was a result of an application filed before the NGT January 17, 2022.

Considering the seriousness of the issue, the NGT constituted an expert committee to inspect the units located within 10 kilometres from Himayatsagar and Osmansagar lakes.

Also read: This Pune stone-crusher unit shows how to do it properly

The tribunal then asked TSPCB to take stringent action against the crusher units operating without ‘Consent for Establishment’ and ‘Consent for Operation’ from the state board.

The NGT asked the crushers to stop violating the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act and the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.

The tribunal’s southern zone bench in Chennai had directed the TSPCB to file the status report of the action taken by the board by November 15.

The following were the findings of the inspection:

Three stone crusher units were operating with valid Consent to Operate and adhering to the environmental norms.

Some 13 units were inactive and were dismantled.

The revenue officials seized 13 stone crushers that violated environmental norms.

TSPCB had ordered the closure of Adeshwar Aggregates Pvt Ltd, a stone crusher, for flouting environmental norms. The authority has also ordered the disconnection of power supply.

The unit was operating without obtaining ‘Consent for Establishment’ and ‘Consent for Operation’ from the state board.

Also read: Mahoba mess continues: NGT seeks report on stone mining

The unit continued to operate with diesel generators without installing air pollution control devices, violating the order. The board rejected the company’s application for Consent for the Establishment as it operated despite TSPCB’s closure order.

It tampered with the lock and seal put on the diesel generator set and jaw crushing machines, which is an illegal act. The unit had flouted the environmental norms and had many shortfalls.

Some of them are are listed below:

Lack of dust containment-cum-suppression system.

Absence of a water sprinkling system to control the dust emission from jaw crusher, cone crusher and conveyors.

Lack of regular cleaning of roads and wetting of the ground within the premises.

Lack of green belt along the periphery of the crusher in accordance with the state guidelines

Later on, the unit filed an appeal before the TSPCB for obtaining Consent to Establishment and Consent to Operate. But the board rejected it owing to the unit’s non-adherence to environmental norms.

The NGT remitted the matter to TSPCB for fresh consideration of merits for ‘Consent to Establishment’ and ‘Consent to Operate’ and permitted the unit to operate.

But later on, TSPCB filed an appeal before the NGT against the same. Finally, the NGT issued an order August 29, 2022. It upheld TPCB’s order and stated that such units should not be allowed to operate.

Way forward

Repeatedly, NGT has to intervene in cases related to illegal stone-crushing units and pollution caused by such units in almost every state in the country.

Generally, the tribunal constitutes committees and asks for a detailed report to understand the root cause of the pollution. This entire process takes a long time.

It is unclear how these illegal stone crushers run and the state board, being a statutory organisation to implement environmental laws and rules within the jurisdiction, misses at times to see such a huge problem.

The state boards usually have a shortage of workforce and cannot visit the field regularly. Considering the seriousness of the issue, the board should not allow crushers to establish beyond the specified crushing zones.

Stringent action should be taken against illegal units for flouting environmental norms.

The sector will always be in demand considering the country’s growth in the construction sector. The operational practices of the sector need to be strengthened and the guidelines released by the state board should be strictly implemented.

An effective mechanism needs to be developed to see to it that the state guidelines for the stone crushers are well implemented on the ground.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-11-29/0.39168200_1669715525_stone.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/blog/mining/telangana-has-shut-illegal-stone-crusher-units-fined-them-but-much-more-needs-to-be-done-86255

Hyderabad: There is an urgent need to create awareness on the climate crisis. There would be no economy if there is no environment, said speakers at an event `Climate Change Impacts on Indian Manufacturing: Policy Change agenda in Energy and Production,’ held by industry body FTCCI in Hyderabad on Friday.

“Climate change can impact all the major sectors in the economy that account for more than 80% of India’s GDP. The overall economic losses due to climate change under business as usual (BAU) is estimated to be about 2% of India’s GDP in 2050. Now is the time for India to act to prevent the country from losing its economic potential by 2050 due to lack of proper effort against climate change,” said FTCCI President Anil Agarwal.

“There is a need to shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy. It is the cheapest and cleanest energy. We are already witnessing extreme heat in cold places, ice melts, flooding across the world due to the climate crisis,” said Bollampally Indrasen Reddy, Four Solar Energy Systems Managing Director.

“We need to adapt to climate change by enhancing investments in agriculture, water resources, Himalayan region, coastal regions, and health and disaster management. Industry can use materials efficiently, reusing, recycling, and minimising waste,” said Dr Narasimha Reddy Donthi, Centre for Earth Leadership and Sustainability.

K Babu Rao, retired scientist from IICT, said there are no signs of Indian Industry moving towards climate compliance. Sadly, the industry was opting for small coal-fired inefficient captive power plants even now.

The famous slogan of late Lal Bahadur Shastri, “Jai Jawan, Jai Kisan,” was extended by Atal Bihari Vajpayee to include “Jai Vigyan”. Now, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has extended it to, “Jai Anusandhan”.

The innovations (anusandhan) needed to be made in the agri-food space by 2047 to have a well-fed India, with zero hunger, almost no malnutrition, climate resilience, and high incomes for our farmers.

INSIGHTS ON THE ISSUE

Context

SOLAR ENERGY:

India, being a tropical country is endowed with plenty of solar energy; hence, exploitation of solar energy becomes an important component of renewable energy sector

India is endowed with vast solar energy potential. About 5,000 trillion kWh per year energy is incident over India’s land area with most parts receiving 4-7 kWh per sq. m per day

Karnataka leads India’s list of states producing solar energy, with a total installed solar power capacity of about 7,100MW; followed by Telangana, Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh and Gujarat

Also, India is now the fourth-largest solar power producer in the world

International Solar Alliance: In pursuance to enhance Solar Energy production, India along with France launched the International Solar Alliance with the aim to promote solar energy in 121 member countries and to mobilize over $1 trillion of investment for the deployment of solar energy at affordable costs.

In pursuance to enhance Solar Energy production, India along with France launched the International Solar Alliance with the aim to promote solar energy in and to mobilize for the deployment of solar energy at affordable costs. 100 GW target: The target set by India, for installed solar energy capacity is 100 GW by March 2023 — 40 GW rooftop solar and 60 GW ground-mounted utility scale

Recent trends:









Poultry and fisheries: Poultry and fisheries have the fastest growth, while it has been the slowest in cereal production.

Poultry and fisheries have the fastest growth, while it has been the slowest in cereal production. More intervention in Cereals: Government intervention is the most in cereals through the massive procurement of rice and wheat. While those sub-sectors that rely on market forces, no matter how imperfect, still perform better.

Government intervention is the most in cereals through the massive procurement of rice and wheat. The policy implication is very clear: Promote and get the markets right, which will help unleash revolutionary growth in agriculture.

Challenges:

Per capita income: The biggest challenge will be feeding a country whose per capita income still hovers around $2,300 The per capita income is likely to grow between 5 to 6 per cent per annum, under normal conditions.

The biggest challenge will be feeding a country whose per capita income still hovers Safe and nutritious food: As they rise from low-income levels, people are likely to demand not just more food but safe and nutritious food.

As they rise from low-income levels, people are likely to demand not just more food but safe and nutritious food. Aligning agri-policies: The challenge would be to align our agri-policies and strategies to the emerging demand pattern.

The challenge would be to align our agri-policies and strategies to the emerging demand pattern. Argumenting farmers income: To make the agri-food system vibrant and competitive requires significantly augmenting farmers’ incomes.

To make the agri-food system vibrant and competitive requires significantly augmenting farmers’ incomes. Declining average land holding: Against the backdrop of continuously declining average holding size from 2.3 hectares in 1970-71 to just 1.08 hectares in 2015-16, cereals can not give high incomes to farmers even when their productivity is increased.

Government Initiatives:

Solutions:

Food system as a composite entity : safe and nutritious food.We need to go beyond just increasing production. We need to focus on the food system as a composite entity. It has five dimensions: Production, Marketing Consumption The environmental sustainability of our food systems Nutritional outcomes Arrest decline in groundwater: We need to arrest the dramatic decline in our groundwater table, particularly in the northwest, rejuvenate our soils, and improve the air quality by stopping/reducing stubble burning and methane emissions. Developing carbon markets: We need to develop carbon markets so that farmers can be incentivised to change existing farming practices that are not compatible with environmental sustainability. This requires innovations in policies, technologies related to precision farming as well as institutional engineering to include millions of smallholders as we did in the case of the white (milk) revolution. Digitisation of agriculture: The digitisation of agriculture can help in this. We need to become a nation of innovators in agriculture like Israel, Holland, and the US. Value chain by involving the private sector: Diversification toward high-value crops is a must as we move forward. It will require building efficient value chains by the private sector. High value agriculture: Policies need to create an ecosystem to promote this form of high-value agriculture and reduce the risks attached to it.

Way Forward

Solar as the third crop: A few out-of-the-box innovations can almost double farmers’ incomes quickly. And one such innovation is to have “ solar as a third crop” on fields. On one acre of cultivated land, which grows two crops a year, one can have more than 400 solar panels (trees) of 10 to 12 feet in height, with due spacing for regular cultivation to continue.

A few out-of-the-box innovations can almost double farmers’ incomes quickly. Najafgarh KVK area as model: A pilot programme in the Najafgarh KVK area revealed that farmers could earn additional income of up to Rs one lakh/acre , when the capital cost is being incurred by another entrepreneur. This concept needs wider validation in different states with good sunshine. This is the “ inclusive growth, green growth” model that needs to supplement the solar parks model being developed by big entrepreneurs.

A pilot programme in the Najafgarh KVK area revealed that farmers could earn additional , when the capital cost is being incurred by another entrepreneur. Environmental consequences: In the mid-1960s to emerging as the largest exporter of rice in the world (21mmt in FY22) , we have neglected the environmental consequences that have ensued. It is time to wake up now and promote climate-resilient agriculture.

In the , we have neglected the environmental consequences that have ensued. Double farmers income: In 2016, the Prime Ministerhad given a clarion call to double farmers’ incomes by 2022-23. That can be done through a single innovation, provided he makes it a campaign and mobilizes investors, farmers, renewable power companies, and discom s in that direction.

In 2016, the Prime Ministerhad given a clarion call to “Har Khet Main Saur Urja”(solar power in every farmer’s field): On the lines of” Har Ghar Tiranga” campaign can be beneficial on a wider scale.

As cities develop, more vegetation is lost, and surfaces are paved or covered with buildings. This change results in less shade and moisture therefore urban areas become warmer than their rural surroundings, a phenomenon known as the ‘urban heat island effect’. There is a large amount of heat released into the atmosphere as an effect of climate change, which is further catalyzed by UHI (heat generated by human-induced activities – unregulated development, air conditioners) making the environment unbearably warm & in a few cases fatal (humidity + UHI effects).

The workshop aimed to disseminate the findings of two action-based research on measures to mitigate the health, environmental, and energy effects of UHI. The study by IIITH (Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad) conducted in summer of 2022 compared the temperatures of grey and freshly coated white roof (high reflective paint) yielding positive results in the form of maximum reduction in the indoor air for the white roof by 3.6°C, and over deck temperatures by 19.8°C, compared to the space with a grey roof. The on-spot measurements for roof surface temperature of a China mosaic roof were found to be similar to freshly coated cool roof. The workshop was attended by municipal corporation staff especially the PWD who got to understand UHI phenomenon, its harmful impacts in the city and discussed mitigation action for reducing the hotspots through building and nature-based solutions. V Krishna IFS, Additional Commissioner, GHMC also attended the workshop and discussed about Greening Hyderabad with parks and Miyawaki forests under the green policy of the Telangana Government. The interactive workshop was designed to support ideas and understand opportunities and challenges in urban heat island mitigation.

Several experiments have been conducted in the last 15 years to understand the impact of cool roofs in reducing temperatures and reducing AC energy use. Cool roofs are a simple and traditional technique that can improve the thermal conditions inside unconditioned buildings which do not have access to mechanical cooling such as low-income housing, primary health centers, hospitals and schools.

Dr Vishal Garg, Professor, IIIT Hyderabad emphasized that with the predictions from various sources, in cities the heat events could get more frequent and much longer in the future, beyond the human survival limit. There is an urgent need to take up mitigation measures for UHI.

Arvind Kumar, Special Chief Secretary, MA&UD has shared a special message during the workshop that the Telangana Govt. is keen on taking forward cool roofs as a mitigation measure and Telangana state will be a forerunner in cool roof implementation at a large scale. Telangana state has drafted a cool roof policy with a target to implement 100 sq. km of cool roof area in Hyderabad and 300 sq. km in Telangana state.

Commenting on the workshop Prerana Langa, CEO, Aga Khan Agency for Habitat India said, “The harsh reality of climate change is manifesting itself in real time in the form of extreme weather events, shifting seasonal patterns, rising sea level rises, and an increase in average surface temperature. Aga Khan Agency for Habitat (AKAH) India, in collaboration with IIIT Hyderabad, conducted a pioneering study using ‘satellite and real-time imagery’ to identify measures to mitigate the risks of Urban Heat Island (UHI), with the goal of ‘building’ climate-conscious cities. This consultation, I am confident, will yield fruitful results and lay the groundwork for future development of strategies to decrease scorching temperatures and achieve thermal comfort in real-time scenarios.”

The International Institute of Information Technology Hyderabad (IIITH) is an autonomous research university founded in 1998 that focuses on the core areas of Information Technology, such as Computer Science, Electronics and Communications, and their applications in other domains through inter-disciplinary research that has a greater social impact.

The Bharat Jodo Yatra entered the state via Gudebellur on October 23 morning, after exiting Karnataka.
He will also visit prayer halls, mosques and temples across Telangana, and will offer prayers, members of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee said.
The Bharat Jodo Yatra commenced on September 7 from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu.","The Congress manifesto for the 2023 Legislative Assembly elections in will have special focus on issues, which would be prepared after extensive consultations with all stakeholders, top party leader said on Thursday.

Gandhi, who resumed his 'Bharat Jodo Yatra' in after a four-day Diwali break, had an interaction with farmers and farmers' representatives from different parts of the state.

The suicides of tenant farmers, lack of crop insurance and disaster relief and problems concerning the 'Dharani' land records portal were discussed, AICC General Secretary, incharge of communications, Jairam Ramesh said.

""@RahulGandhi also promised that the Congress manifesto for the upcoming Assembly elections in will have a very sharp focus on issues and will be prepared after the widest possible consultations with all stakeholders,"" Ramesh tweeted. Observing that 30 per cent peasants in the state are tenant-farmers and they account for 80 per cent of suicides since 2014, Ramesh alleged that the TRS government has failed miserably to provide any relief to bereaved families.

Gandhi met the widows who are still struggling to make ends meet as women farmers, he said. Since Kharif 2020, Telangana does not have any crop insurance scheme nor has it given any compensation for disasters through the 2005 NDMA (National Disaster Management) Act. This has deprived lakhs of farmers of compensation when there is crop loss, the frequency of which has increased due to climate change, the AICC General Secretary claimed. He further alleged that the ""much advertised"" 'Rythu Bandhu' investment support scheme of the TRS government meant for farmers does not benefit tenant farmers and cultivators in any way.

assured that tenant farmers and those who till the land must be registered and get full benefit of government schemes, including bank loans, direct income transfer and crop insurance. Noting that the farmers also complained of the 'Dharani' scheme in Telangana, Ramesh said it is criminal that a scheme to modernise land records is dispossessing tens of thousands of Dalits, Adivasis and other Backwards castes of their own lands.

After a gap of four days, the Rahul Gandhi-led Bharat Jodo Yatra resumed from Makthal in Narayanpet district of Telangana today.

The yatra kicked off at 6.30 AM from Makthal with state Congress president A Revanth Reddy, MP Uttam Kumar Reddy, CLP leader Bhatti Vikramarka and a number of party leaders joining Gandhi.

This is the second day of the yatra in the state. The Bharat Jodo Yatra entered the state via Gudebellur on October 23 morning, after exiting Karnataka.

After a brief march, it took a break from Sunday noon till October 26. Gandhi who left for the national capital on October 23, landed here last night and left for Gudebellur by road.

The Yatra is expected to enter Maharashtra on November 7. It will take a one-day break on November 4.

The Wayanad MP will meet intellectuals, leaders of various communities, including personalities from the sporting, business and entertainment sectors.

He will also visit prayer halls, mosques and temples across Telangana, and will offer prayers, members of the Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee said. The Bharat Jodo Yatra commenced on September 7 from Kanyakumari in Tamil Nadu. Gandhi completed the marathon walk in Kerala, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka, before beginning the Telangana leg of the yatra.

Icrisat is an international research organisation based in Hyderabad and it focuses on crops for the semi-arid tropics.

Past Budgets have emphasised organic agriculture and paramparagat or traditional cultivation practices. These do not use chemical inputs or use them sparingly. They are low on emissions. These are niche areas but they cannot feed a growing population sustainably. For that, we need regenerative agriculture that is not free of chemicals but uses them judiciously along with crops and practices that improve soil health, reduce water use, and avert or minimise emissions.

Cluster approach needed

Advertisement

Individual crops should not be seen in isolation but as components of cropping systems that adapt to local natural resources, as well as the income of farmers. In the water-depleted zones of Punjab, for instance, a maize, mustard, and moong bean cropping system does just this. Maize uses less water; mustard is an oilseed that has high oil content (which India needs to check dependence on imported edible oil), while moong bean absorbs nitrogen from the air and stores them in the soil, not only reducing its own requirement of urea but also that of the next crop, which is maize.

Watch: Carbon Credits For ‘Climate-Smart’ Agriculture

But Punjab meets its demand of maize from Bihar, which has abundant water, while it grows rice that requires water it is deficient in. Policies that make electricity available free in Punjab are to blame. But a cluster approach is also needed. Traders will not buy kharif maize, which has high moisture, as it results in aflatoxin contamination. So, dryers will have to be put up. But these dryers will not be established unless there is sufficient volume. The combine harvesters needed to harvest maize require devices that cost about Rs 5 lakh each. So, unless there is sufficient acreage under maize, the equipment hirers will not invest in the maize harvesting devices, Jat said.

Need for conservation tillage

Tractor emissions can be reduced by practising no-till or low-till agriculture. The world over, more than 200 million hectares are under conservation tillage. In India, too, it is catching up, particularly in Punjab, where it is touted as a solution to avert the burning of paddy stubble. Direct-seeded rice minimises water use and the emissions that are generated during the production of electricity or the use of diesel pumps. Much of the water that is impounded in paddy fields is meant to curb the growth of weeds; rice in itself does not need so much water. But can we afford to use large quantities of water as a herbicide? Direct-seeded rice does not need transplanting or puddling, but herbicides will have to be used to curb the growth of weeds.

Ploughing or tillage results in the oxidation of carbon sequestered in soil. The release of nitrous oxides also contributes to earth warming. India will have to improve nitrogen use efficiency, which currently is about 40%, which means 60% of the urea that is applied is wasted. Jat said this can be done by growing leguminous crops and also using biologicals or soil microbes. Fertigation and the use of urea prills also reduces wastage.

Jat said the Budget should incentivise the cultivation of millets, which are not only nutritious but also use less water. They should be integrated with cropping systems.

The Green Revolution was high-input-high-output agriculture. We need more-for-less agriculture. We will have to invest in breeding, both conventional and genetic, to create seeds that are resilient to dry spells, flooding, salinity, and threats from pests and diseases.

Pesticide Action Network (PAN) India believes stricter action is needed.
In India, glyphosate has been approved for use only in tea plantations and non-plantation areas accompanying the tea crop.
However, a 2020 study by PAN India on the state of glyphosate use in the country had worrying findings.
Allowing continued use of glyphosate in India will contribute to widespread use of illegal herbicide tolerant crops, PAN India said in a statement.","Experts welcome move but call for a complete ban

The Union Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare issued a notice October 21, 2022 restricting the use of glyphosate, a widely used herbicide, citing health hazards for humans and animals. Only authorised Pest Control Operators are allowed to use it.

Earlier, state governments of Maharashtra, Telangana, Punjab and Andhra Pradesh have tried similar steps but failed. Pesticide Action Network (PAN) India believes stricter action is needed.

The notification was based on a 2019 report by the Government of Kerala on prohibiting the distribution, sale and use of glyphosate and its derivatives.

“It is indeed a remarkable development regarding the regulation of highly hazardous pesticides in India,” Jayakumar Chelaton, director of PAN India, was quoted as saying in a statement.

But restricting use of the weedicide through pest control operators is inadequate as it cannot reduce or eliminate the inherent hazard of glyphosate and the risk arising from its use, he added. “As the government of India (is) now satisfied with the fact that glyphosate use causes health hazards and risk to people and animals, it needs to be banned urgently.”

Some 35 countries have banned or restricted the use of glyphosate. These include Sri Lanka, Netherlands, France, Colombia, Canada, Israel and Argentina.

Health impacts of glyphosate range from cancer, reproductive and developmental toxicity to neurotoxicity and immunotoxicity. Symptoms include irritation, swelling, burning of the skin, oral and nasal discomfort, unpleasant taste and blurred vision.

In India, glyphosate has been approved for use only in tea plantations and non-plantation areas accompanying the tea crop. Use of the substance anywhere else is illegal.

However, a 2020 study by PAN India on the state of glyphosate use in the country had worrying findings. Field studies were conducted in Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Telangana and West Bengal.

Glyphosate was being used in more than 20 crop fields, it was found. Majority of those using the weedicide were not trained for doing so and did not have the appropriate safety precautions.

The rampant use of glyphosate in non-designated areas has severe consequences. Narasimha Reddy, a public policy expert and advisor of PAN India, said in a statement:

Use of all weedicides including glyphosate is destroying uncultivated food resources and thereby destroying indigenous nutrition habits as well, making rural people and agricultural communities deprived of adequate nutrition, in addition to polluting ecosystems.

The government needs to come forward to ban glyphosate urgently, he added.

The government’s current move, to restrict the use of glyphosate, may not necessarily work as the presence of pest control operators is “almost non-existent” on the ground, according to PAN India.

The new notification mandates that existing registration certification be put through a further process. Failure to do so will result in appropriate action being taken under the Insecticides Act of 1968.

Allowing continued use of glyphosate in India will contribute to widespread use of illegal herbicide tolerant crops, PAN India said in a statement. This will endanger the agroecological nature of Indian farms, apart from spreading the toxic effects to people, animals and the environment, the organisation warned.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-10-31/0.22737100_1667190616_istock-1398673288.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/centre-restricts-use-of-common-weedicide-glyphosate-citing-health-hazards-85684

Siddipet: Proving that necessity is indeed the mother of invention, a young tenant farmer from Siddipet district has designed and manufactured a trolley for his two-wheeler to meet daily requirements on his farm.

The 28-year-old farmer, Sarla Raju, owns no agricultural land, but has taken six acres of land on lease in his own village. Cultivating paddy on the six acres, Raju is also managing a mini dairy farm with two buffaloes and four cows. Since he needs to harvest and transport grass from his field to his home every day, his two-wheeler turned out to be quite inadequate for the purpose. He was shuttling between the field and his home four to five times a day. With balancing the huge load of grass on the two-wheeler being quite a risky affair too, Raju began thinking of a tractor or bullock cart.

But with both options being quite costly for him, Raju says he decided to design a small trolley for his bike. He browsed YouTube for such models and found one such video from north India. After carefully learning the design a year ago, Raju consulted a welder in Siddipet, who agreed to make the trolley after watching the video. Since then, Raju has been using the trolley to fetch grass from the field and feed for his cattle from Cheriyal town located 10 km away from Komuravelly.

He also ferries half a dozen labourers in the trolley to his field. His ingenuity is helping him save a lot of time and money, Raju says.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/siddipet-6.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/siddipet-bike-trolley-makes-life-easy-for-tenant-farmer

Farmers in the state, especially in south Bengal, heavy losses as Aman paddy cultivation has been hit by rainfall deficit.
“Farmers have not been able to even sow the seeds due to the lack of rain,” said Anil Gope, a paddy farmer from Burdwan district.
Farmer Kartik Mandal from Hoogly district’s Khanakul has sown paddy seeds on three bighas of land, hoping for better rain.
“I have already sowed 22 kgs of paddy seeds on my six bighas.","Heavy rain for rest of monsoon might complete the deficit, says IMD, but will that be enough?

Kharif crops in West Bengal have been severely affected due to insufficient rain this monsoon season. Farmers in the state, especially in south Bengal, heavy losses as Aman paddy cultivation has been hit by rainfall deficit.

West Bengal has a deficit of 39 per cent, while south Bengal has a deficit of 47 per cent.

“Farmers have not been able to even sow the seeds due to the lack of rain,” said Anil Gope, a paddy farmer from Burdwan district.

Gope has 10 bighas of agricultural land. “There is no irrigation system here, so farming is completely dependent on rainwater,” he said. “If the rainfall becomes normal by August 15, I still have a chance to harvest crops. Else I will face huge losses.” A bigha of land is around 0.62 acres.

The farmer invests around Rs 60,000 on his farm every year. He will lose earnings for the entire year if there is no rain, as post-monsoon potato and mustard crops would also be affected.

Monsoon had a late start in the region this year, around June 18, which is a delay of 10 days, said GK Das, director, India Meteorological Department (IMD) in Kolkata. This year, the monsoon is estimated to officially withdraw from Bengal on October 10.

“The overall deficiency is primarily caused by two reasons: Late onset of monsoon and no low-pressure area near Bangladesh or Bay of Bengal to bring more rain to West Bengal,” he said.

Low pressures in these areas lead to heavy to mid-level rain in south Bengal. A low-pressure area was created near the Andhra coast; therefore, Andhra Pradesh and Telangana had enough rain in July, for example.

Monsoon 2022 is expected to be normal for Bengal, Das said. “However, two to three good depressions or low-pressure systems are needed for a normal monsoon,” he said.

There may be some heavy or continuous rains in the remaining days of July and all of August, September and the beginning of October, the weatherman added.

“As we are facing extreme weather events due to climate change. Continuous or heavy rainfall can help recover from the deficiency,” Das said

Major paddy-growing districts like Howrah, Hoogly, Nadia and Burdwan are already lagging in sowing this season compared to previous years.

“So far, I have not invested in Aman harvesting at all,” said Tosalia Dhabek from Nadia district’s Hanshkhali.

Dhabek has 10 bighas of agricultural land, and he usually harvests paddy on around half of it, investing around Rs 25,000.

“There is no rain and irrigation systems aren’t working as well in the absence of enough rain. Even if it rains at August-end, paddy farming is possible,” the farmer said.

“Then it will be mustard in September-October and again paddy in February,” Dhabek said. No Aman harvest will mean a huge setback for him.

Farmer Kartik Mandal from Hoogly district’s Khanakul has sown paddy seeds on three bighas of land, hoping for better rain. He has two acres where he also plants potatoes and almonds.

“I have to spend Rs 105 per litre of kerosene to run a water pump for my farm. On sowing days, the pump runs for four hours a day. This is impossible for small-scale farmers,” he said. Good rain for the rest of the monsoon will give him a chance to recover his money.

Mandal is a member of a cooperative society which gives him a loan of Rs 30,000 for Aman harvesting. He has sown 15 kilograms of paddy seeds, priced at Rs 105 per kg.

The farmer had already faced losses in his almond harvest earlier this year due to continuous rain at the end of April. Last year, he sold Rs 2,47,000 worth of almonds but didn’t even get a lakh rupees this time.

Another farmer complained that seeds are drying up due to lack of rain. “I have already sowed 22 kgs of paddy seeds on my six bighas. It will all be ruined if there is no rain. How will I survive,” asked Manotosh Dolui from Howrah district’s Amta.

Dolui has sown seeds priced 60 per kg in his low-lying land and seeds priced 72 per kg on the high ground. He usually invests Rs 40,000-50,000 for a return of around Rs 60,000-70,000, barely enough to sustain his family.

“Even irrigation systems need some good rain,” he said.

Like Mandal, Dolui also faced losses in his mustard and almond nuts.

However, he lost his crops to a lack of rain after March. “I only got 8-10 kgs of harvest per katha of land, instead of the usual 30-32 kgs,” he said. A katha is equal to 0.0165 acres of land.

The Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)-led government on April 11 brought its protest against the Union government’s “discriminatory” paddy procurement policy to the national capital.

Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao (KCR), along with his state cabinet, legislators, parliamentarians and other TRS leaders and workers, sat on a day-long ‘maha dharna’ at Telangana Bhawan in Delhi. Their demand: The Centre should procure the 1.5 million tonnes of parboiled rice from the state.

Raw rice is partially boiled and dried to make parboiled rice. It is mainly produced in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Jharkhand and Kerala.

KCR gave a warning to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Hindi not to “mess” with the farmers. He gave a 24-hour deadline to the government to respond if it will buy the rice from the state on MSP or not.

He said from the stage:

Why did all the ministers, MLAs and representatives of farmer groups come here from 2,000 kilometres away in this strong heat? Why were they feeling so helpless? What sin did the farmers of Telangana commit? Was growing paddy a sin?

“I want to give a warning to India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi that he can mess with anyone but not with the farmers,” the chief minister added.

He referred to the Union Minister of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution Piyush Goyal as ‘Piyush Golmaal’ multiple times during his address.

“I request with folded hands on behalf of Telangana farmers to Narendra Modiji and Piyush Goyalji that as you are procuring paddy from all states, please procure from Telangana also. We will wait for 24 hours for a response from you. After that we will make a decision about what to do. We know what to do. Jo karna hai vo karenge uske saath bas aapke peeche padna hai. Ab hum nikal padenge desh me aur dekhiye kya kya hota hai (We will be after you and take the protest across the country),” he said.

Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) leader Rakesh Tikait, who was one of the crucial leaders during the year-long farmers’ protest in Delhi, was also seen on the stage.

The Centre and Telangana government have been at loggerheads over the issue of paddy procurement in the state for quite a while now. The Government of Telangana has been demanding 100 per cent procurement from the state’s farmers, on the lines of procurement in Punjab and Haryana. Telangana saw an entire week of protests and blockades over the issue.

The Centre, however, had made it clear earlier that the Food Corporation of India (FCI) will only procure raw rice and not buy parboiled rice from any state.

A delegation of ministers from Telangana had met the Prime Minister in November 2021 to raise the issue. The PM had reportedly told the state government that FCI will not buy parboiled rice.

Following this, the state government had asked farmers in the state to cultivate other crops, KCR said. Telangana’s agriculture minister as well as other ministers and all the village sarpanches were talking about shifting to other crops, he added.

“But then, two BJP leaders — G Kishan Reddy (a minister at the Centre) and Bandi Sanjay Kumar (Telangana’s BJP president) began goading farmers to grow paddy. They said they will buy the produce and asked them not to listen to the CM.”

He also displayed a video clip of Reddy trying to influence the farmers.

FCI will not be in a position to accept parboiled rice due to the massive stock of parboiled rice in the central pool and the states were apprised of this, Ashwani Kumar Choubey, Union minister of state for consumer affairs, food and public distribution told the Parliament February 9, 2022. He was replying to a question on parboiled rice.

A cause in the memorandum of understanding signed between Centre and state governments stipulated that if the stocks of the rice procured by the state government exceeds its allocation under the public distribution system, such excess stocks shall be handed over to FCI by the state government, according to the reply.

FCI, however, shall have the option to specify whether such excess rice that would be handed over to it for the central pool shall be in the form of raw rice or parboiled rice to meet the overall consumption requirement of the country.

Meanwhile, Telangana BJP unit was staging a protest in the state against the KCR government, asking it to “procure paddy or step down”.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-04-11/0.95736800_1649679451_trs-in-delhi.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/-don-t-mess-with-telangana-farmers-kcr-s-warning-to-modi-government-at-delhi-rally-on-paddy-procurement-82325

Get the private sector involved in building value chains so that both farmers and investors earn good profits.

Hyderabad: The wall between the Modi government and the Samyukta Kisan Morcha (SKM) has been getting thicker. The government had hoped it would collapse with Modi’s address to the nation on November 19, 2021, promising repeal of the three farm laws; it didn’t. It had hoped it would crash with their repeal by Parliament on November 29, 2021; it didn’t. It had hoped it would crumble with the announcement of a committee on MSP (minimum support price) on July 18, 2022; it didn’t.

The SKM refused to join the committee, saying it had ‘so-called’ farmers’ leaders who had openly backed the three farm laws. Ignoring the SKM’s absence, the committee is going ahead with its deliberations. It has already held three meetings. The SKM is going ahead with its agitation for legally guaranteed MSP. The committee is holding its meetings indoors; the SKM is holding its meetings on the streets.

Absence of Dialogue

The absence of dialogue between the government and the SKM is not good for the country. The farmers are the backbone of agriculture. And agriculture is the backbone of the country’s economy. If the farmers suffer, agriculture will suffer; if agriculture suffers, the economy will suffer. Perhaps, owing to minor setbacks to the BJP from the farmers’ movement in recent elections, the government doesn’t care much about their voice anymore. It is making a serious mistake. The farmers are the crew of the ship of agriculture. Unless they are on board, the ship will flounder.

The government is the management that sets the ship’s destination. It knows where the vessel has to go. Even the farmers, the crew, know where it has to go. The two only differ on how to reach there. The battle between the government and the SKM is convergence on the goal and divergence on the means.

Both the government’s and the farmers’ immediate big goal is crop diversification in the original green revolution region — Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh. The farmers of the region abandoned other crops (millets, pulses, oilseeds) and started growing rice and wheat as the government lured them with assured procurement at assured prices, beginning the 1960s. The rice-wheat cropping, particularly rice, sucked the upper aquifers dry. The farmers sank tubewells into lower aquifers to draw water, only to get metallic pollutants with it, which hindered the generation of soil nutrients that were already in short supply owing to endless, Ghazni-like invasions by chemicals for higher yields.

The nation with a begging bowl desperately wanted food security, and the farmers of Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, motivated by assured income, helped it achieve it. But a time came when both saw a nightmare eclipsing the fantasy. The yield stagnated, and with it the farmers’ income. Water threatened to become as elitist a commodity as silk in not so long a future, not just for irrigation but even for drinking purposes.

In 2013-14, the Central government introduced a crop diversification programme in Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh with the idea of moving farmers away from paddy to millets, pulses, oilseeds, vegetables and fruits, crops that do not beggar the aquifers or the soil. Crop diversification continues to be a programme of the Central government. But in the past eight years, it has not made any significant progress.

In Haryana, paddy has been replaced with cotton on 20,000 hectares, which is merely 1.5% of the total paddy area. In Punjab, whose soil anaemia is the most severe among the three States, the programme has not taken off. Nor has it in UP.

Shy to Switch

The reason is obvious. The farmers are reluctant to switch to other crops. Their reluctance is founded on some pragmatic reasons. First, rice fetches them an assured sale with an assured income. Secondly, it brings higher income than other crops. According to official data, in 2018-19, a farmer in Punjab earned about Rs 75,000 from paddy, but only Rs 26,000 from potato, Rs 15,000 from maize and Rs 9,000 from gram per hectare.

Thirdly, though the government fixes MSP even for 21 crops other than rice and wheat — such as millets, pulses, oilseeds and cash crops — it does not procure them. Fourthly, the government, to fulfil its national food security aims, has established over the years a whole ecosystem — MSP, technologies, research, extension, procurement, processing — for paddy and wheat, which does not exist for other crops.

The government cannot motivate farmers to abandon paddy unless it is willing to establish secure ecosystems for alternative crops to help them earn a higher income. Here lies the kernel of confrontation between the government and the SKM: the SKM wants the government to establish secure ecosystems, beginning with a legally guaranteed MSP. A guaranteed MSP means even private traders cannot pay the farmers less than that for their produce. If the farmers can expect an assured profit in other crops, they will take the road to diversification in increasing numbers.

Funds First

The trouble with the ultra pro-reform Modi government is that it wants to minimise public spending on agriculture and open it up for the market. But with reduced public investment, you cannot establish secure ecosystems for crop diversification. There has not been as much research to develop high-yielding, pest-resistant and climate-resilient varieties of pulses, oilseeds and millets as there has been of rice or wheat. You need funds for research. The type of soil in one village may differ from that in another; so you need more extension workers to guide farmers in diversifying to other crops.

Public spending is needed to build a value chain for every alternative crop — from input supply to production to marketing to warehousing to processing — with incentives for private investment. It is only when the farmers see more profits in other crops that they will move away from rice. And more profits cannot come without a value chain.

It is in establishing value chains that the government must get the private sector involved. The government mistakenly tried to get the private sector involved in farming and trading through the three farm laws, which threatened the existence of farmers. It must instead get the private sector involved in building value chains where both the farmers and the market earn good profits. India cannot recast the nation’s food bowl without making both the farmers and the private investors happy.

Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman’s Budget speech on February 1 will likely include a set of measures to boost investments in agriculture infrastructure, including those aimed at encouraging private investments.

Food and fertiliser subsidies, which have relevance for the sector, is set to cross Rs 5 trillion in FY23 due to the volatility in international prices of hydrocarbons and other fertiliser inputs and the free food grains supply scheme. The total expenditure on these subsidies is expected to moderate in FY24 to less than Rs 4 trillion, which is still an elevated level.

Official sources indicate that the coming Budget may also meaningfully increase the outlay for agricultural research and development (R&D), and unveil steps to promote usage of nano fertilisers to reduce import dependence.

The share of gross value added (GVA) in agriculture and allied sectors rose to 20.2% and 18.8%, respectively, in FY21 and FY22 from the trend level of around 18%, partly because other sectors of the economy suffered more during the pandemic.

Adequate monsoon rains in the last four years also have positively impacted the sector as food grains production rose by more than 10% since 2018-19 to a record 315.72 million tonne (MT) in 2021-22 crop year (July-June).

Since the launch of Rs 1 trillion Agri Infrastructure Fund a year back, projects worth Rs 13,680 crore have been sanctioned so far. Experts say that the focus of the Budget would be to give a boost to the livestock sector which grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of a robust 8.15% over the five years ending 2019-20. In contrast, the production of rice, wheat and coarse cereals expanded at CAGRs of 2.7%, 2.9% and 4.8%, respectively, between 2015-16 and 2020-21.

“Stimulating investment in the animal husbandry sector should be given high priority in the coming budget,” Pratap Birthal, director, National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research (NCAP), said.

In the last four years, annual allocations to the department of agriculture and farmer welfare have been in the range of Rs 1-1.24 trillion, of which a major chunk went towards the Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi (PM-Kisan) scheme. In the current fiscal, Rs 68,000 crore or 55% of the allocation to the agriculture ministry was for the income support scheme for farmers — PM-Kisan — launched in 2019. Currently, Rs 6000 is annually transferred to around 100 million farmers bank accounts in three equal installments.

“We envisage a similar outlay of PM-Kisan in FY24,” an agriculture ministry official said. The government is likely to release the 13th instalments of PM-Kisan to farmers this month. The budgetary allocation for R&D in the agricultural sector for development of new crop varieties and technologies, which had been stagnated in the range of Rs 7,000-8,000 crore annually in the last five years, is likely to get a boost given the urgent needs for developing climate resilient crop varieties.

“Financial allocation for research and development and micro irrigation should get a substantial boost so that productivity of crops could be enhanced substantially and make Indian agriculture globally competitive,” Ashok Gulati, agricultural economist and Infosys Chair Professor for Agriculture. Indian Council for Research on International Economic Relations (ICRIER), said. He added that the Budget should chart out steps for rationalisation of fertiliser and food subsidies.

The farmers’ income on an average may increase by around 70% nationally in seven years through June 2023, falling short of the target of doubling their income during the period, even though some states, including Andhra Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, may achieve the goal fully. At the national level, one of the reasons for not achieving the target will be the non-implementation of farm reforms such as model Agriculture Produce Marketing (Regulation) Act, Livestock Marketing Act and Land Leasing Act.

The Budget is expected to announce revamp of flagship Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) through measures, including the usage of AI-based technologies, so that more states come on board after dropping out because of fiscal constraints, for implementation of the scheme where subsidies on premium is shared between centre and states.

Currently, 19 states and union territories are implementing the crop insurance scheme. Punjab, which has not adopted the scheme launched in 2016, is in discussion with the agriculture ministry to launch the scheme from kharif 2023 in the state. Telangana, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat, which had dropped out of the crop insurance scheme citing the high cost of premium, have initiated discussion with the Centre to roll out PMFBY by next year.

To reduce rising fertiliser subsidy which is expected to reach a record Rs 2.5 trillion in FY23, the Budget is expected to provide a road map for reducing import dependence on soil nutrients through boosting production of nano-urea (launched last year) and introduction of nano-DAP in coming kharif season.

Fertiliser secretary Arun Singhal recently said that out of 35 MT of annual urea demand, potentially 20 MT can be replaced by nano urea. “Even if that does happen to the fullest extent in the next couple of years, the urea imports will be ruled out by 2025,” he said.

For promotion usage of drones in agriculture for crop assessment, digitisation of land records, spraying of insecticides, and nutrients as announced in the previous year budget, the agriculture ministry, under the sub-mission on agricultural mechanisation, provides subsidies in the range of 40-100% for the cost of drones.

Sources said the Budget is expected to announce sops under the proposed digital agriculture mission for usage of advanced technologies in crop forecasting, application of inputs and weather forecast. In her FY23 Budget speech, Sitharaman had announced promotion of ‘chemical-free natural farming’ with a focus on farmers’ lands in 5-km wide corridors along river Ganga. This year’s budget announcement could include financial allocation for promotion of natural farming.

Sources said there will be a sizable increase in financial allocation provided under the Bhartiya Prakritik Krishi Padhati (BPKP), a sub-scheme under the Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana being implemented by the agriculture ministry.

After the discontinuation of Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana or free ration scheme from December 31, 2022, the government envisages a food subsidy of around Rs 2 trillion in FY24 from an estimated Rs 2.73 trillion in FY 23. The government last month had announced providing food grain to states under the National Food Security Act free from January 1, 2023 for one year.

The MSP of paddy and wheat has been consistently rising at slightly higher than earlier in recent years thanks to the policy of cost-plus-50% returns ensured since the 2019-20 marketing year. Also, with the exception of the current rabi marketing year (April-June) when wheat procurement dropped sharply, MSP purchases from the farmers have been around 60 MT annually. Currently, the government fixes MSP for 23 crops grown in both kharif and rabi seasons.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/agri1.jpg,[],https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/agriculture-infrastructure-to-get-a-leg-up-road-map-for-subsidy-recast-likely/2939442/

Hyderabad: Continuing the trend of setting examples for other States, Telangana has recorded the second highest increase in forest cover in the country. And once again, it is the State government’s flagship green initiative, Telangana Ku Haritha Haram, that helped India’s youngest State achieve this substantial increase.

The State government planted 235.59 crore seedlings till January 2022 against the target of planting 230 crore seedlings under the Haritha Haram programme, which was launched in 2015-16, achieving 102.6 per cent plantations.

According to the India State of Forest Report (ISFR) 2021, Telangana has a forest cover of 21,214 square kilometres. There is an increase of 632 square kilometres between ISFR 2019 and ISFR 2021, which is the second highest increase in forest cover in the country, according to union Minister of State for Environment, Forest and Climate Change Ashwini Kumar Choubey, who stated this in the Rajya Sabha on Thursday.

Interestingly, BJP-ruled States like Uttar Pradesh (12), Madhya Pradesh (11), Maharashtra (20), Gujarat (69) and Karnataka (155) recorded very less increase in forest cover.

Choubey’s reply came to a question from BRS MP B Parthasaradhi Reddy, who had sought details on the steps taken by the union government to highlight and disseminate the best practices adopted by Telangana to increase the forest cover across the country.

In reply, Choubey said these best practices of any State were highlighted and disseminated across the country through national workshops and regional workshops on afforestation, forest fire management. This apart, distribution of pamphlets and presentations were being done on suitable occasions, besides field visits by officers from other States, he said.

On the timelines set to achieve the targeted 33 per cent forest cover in the country, the Union Minister said there was no timeline set under the National Forest Policy to achieve these targets.

The Ministry was undertaking various afforestation and tree plantation programmes such as National Mission for a Green India (GIM), Nagar Van Yojana, CAMPA etc, he added.

In addition, Marut Drones have been accorded RPTO (remote pilot training organisation) approvals which enables training and capacity building of drone pilots focussed on safe agriculture operations, repair and maintenance. Marut Drones is tying up with major universities to enable drone pilots with high-quality training and with this, it sees a vision of the development of two lakh drone entrepreneurs in rural India. According to DGCA, RPTO is an organisation authorised by the DGCA to impart remote pilot training to any individual seeking for a remote pilot certificate under Rule 34 of Drone Rules 2021.

DGCA certification is provided on the basis of quality checks and is issued after a testing process of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in various NABL-accredited testing labs. This makes UAV go through a series of material, environmental, and operational tests for safe, secured and reliable operations. The certification enables the Hyderabad-based firm to bring the users their agricultural drone technology which can revolutionise Indian agriculture.

Highlighting the development, Prem Kumar Vislawath, Founder, Marut Drones said, “Marut Drones has been taking steps in line with its vision of advancing agriculture. Manual spraying in agriculture has caused huge negative health impacts on operators. And a mindless repetition of these sprays is inhumane exposing the operator to chemicals and leading to cancers. With both type certification and RPTO approvals by DGCA, the manual inhumane operations can be easily performed by drone making it safe to the operator. This also creates new job opportunities in rural areas. A drone entrepreneur using this drone can earn anywhere between Rs.40,000 to Rs.90,000 enabling him to work in the comfort of his home making a positive impact on farmers.”

Underlining the AG 365 drone, Suraj Peddi, Co-Founder, Marut Drones said, “All the drones in the market can only be used for a single purpose like spraying pesticides in the farms. Understanding the ground reality of farmers, for better ROI and product experience we have built the first multi-purpose drone. Our AG 365 is similar to tractors and one can do more than just spraying by changing the attachment. This will give better ROI to the user and the drone can be used across years for different purposes in agriculture.”

Hyderabad: In a major development, the centre has on Friday granted environmental clearance to Chanaka-Korata barrage on Penganga river inter state Irrigation Project situated in Adilabad district.

As per the Expert Appraisal Committee (EAC), the Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change approved the grant of environmental clearance to the project for construction of common components of barrage and canal works in Telangana. The order maintained that the environmental clearance to canal work of Maharashtra portion of the project might be considered after submission of necessary forest clearance.

The Jal Shakti Ministry in November last year gave the nod for the construction of Chanaka-Korata Barrage along with Choutpally Hanumanth Reddy Lift Irrigation Scheme in Nizamabad district, and the Mukteshwar (Chinna Kaleshwaram) Lift Irrigation Scheme (LIS) in Jayashankar Bhupalpally district.

The long pending inter-State project became a reality with the TRS government holding a series of consultations with its counterpart of Maharashtra in 2016. It is one of three projects jointly taken up by both Telangana and Maharashtra States, at an expenditure of Rs 1,568 crore. Accordingly, the works of the barrage, pump house, and canals were taken up at Korata village in Jainath mandal and Chanaka of neighboring Maharashtra State in 2018.

The barrage is aimed at providing irrigation facilities to ryots in four mandals under Boath and Adilabad segments. The construction of the barrage and erection of all 23 gates have been completed. The storage capacity of Chanaka-Korata is about 0.8 tmcft. An ayacut of 38,000 acres is to be irrigated with gravity canal and 13,500 acres with two motors with 5.5 MW capacity each have been proposed. In the upstream of the barrage, another 10,000 acres have been proposed under Pipalkoti barrage, which is yet to be constructed.

The then Maharashtra and Andhra Pradesh governments had reached an understanding on October 6, 1975, to take up Lower Penganga project as an interstate joint project. But, there has been no much progress in the erstwhile AP.

As per the interstate agreement, the Maharashtra government has to construct Rajapet and Pimparad barrages. However, the Maharashtra government is yet to start the works. But, Telangana has completed Chanaka-Korata barrage, in which Maharashtra will have 20 per cent water share. Meanwhile, Telangana will get 50 per cent share of water in Rajapet and 30 per cent share of water in Pimparad barrages, to be constructed by Maharashtra.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/File-Photo.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/adilabad-chanaka-korata-barrage-gets-environmental-clearance

30 December 2022, New Delhi: The Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) has launched ‘Project Jagruti Abhiyaan’ across India to train and support local cotton farmers while empowering smallholder farming communities around the world.

Recently Louis Dreyfus Company organized an effective meet and field visit to train progressive cotton farmers in the village Dhamera, Hanumakonda district of Hyderabad in Telangana. Cotton Platform Head of LDC, Mr. Sumeet Mittal, and Senior Manager Research Mr. Gangadhara S were present at the meeting.

Farmers in Telangana have been cultivating cotton for 15 to 20 years and are getting 8 to 10 quintals per acre.

About the project

Project Jagruti was launched in late 2021 in response to an outbreak of pink bollworm and the limited knowledge of farmers on pest management because of which farmers suffered huge losses. There was a potential to increase yield by 3-5 quintals per acre by effectively managing cotton pests.

At the start of 2022, the Louis Dreyfus Company (LDC) started to train and support local cotton farmers in adopting more sustainable agricultural practices, as part of their commitment to empowering farming communities of smallholder farmers in India.

A series of educational workshops were organized under the project. During the workshops, specific methods were demonstrated along with technical advice from experts to help reduce yield loss due to pest infestation, thereby increasing production and income.

Through the project, LDC has so far trained over 2,500 farmers in scientific and technical pest control methods and equipped them with over 15,000 pheromone traps.

In September 2022, LDC launches its second series of workshops in southern and central India, aiming to reach a total of over 7,500 farmers across India’s cotton-growing states and plans to distribute 40,000 pheromone traps by the end of the year for effective management of pink bollworm.

Project Jagriti has been successfully implemented in the states of Punjab, Haryana, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and Karnataka so far covering about 7500 hectares.

As organic seeds procured by us were from different agro-climatic conditions, we decided to procure open-pollinated seeds from the IARI and NSCL as well.
This is the first in a series of stories documenting CSE’s experiment with natural / organic farming.","Local shops and India’s premier research institute failed to provide organic seeds of vegetable

Chemicals in food harms human health and the environment in various ways and the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), Delhi-based think tank, has been flagging this for a long time now.

There is an urgent need of providing all necessary support to scale up organic / natural farming in India, the non-profit has highlighted.

The organisation recently started an important work of capacity building of state’s agriculture extension officials on organic / natural farming, in partnership with the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, Hyderabad.

Seeing is believing. So, the two organisations conducted a live demonstration of organic / natural farming at CSE’s Anil Agarwal Environmental Training Institute’s campus in Nimli village, Alwar district, Rajasthan. Alwar is located in the northern plain, including Aravallis in the hot, semi-arid agro ecological sub-region.

The idea was to have first-hand experience, monitor and document the results of the demonstration plot.

It is also imperative to understand the conditions and challenges the farmers face while trying to transition to chemical-free farming.

We can safely say that farming is a gamble. There are so many uncertainties in a farmer’s life. Which crop to grow? Will the selected crop fetch a good price in the market?

Then there are weather uncertainties and crop losses. Whether seeds, fertilisers and pesticides purchased from the market or received from the agriculture department will work is another concern.

The moment we, the researchers of CSE, put ourselves in the farmers’ shoes and started working on the 0.25 acre demo plot, we were also met with the same questions.

We started planning for our demo plot in August 2022. The journey since then has been filled with excitement, joy, fears and real-life challenges.

Kalpatharu model: Fulfilling desires

We opted for a staggered vegetable production model known as Kalpatharu model. Kalpatharu is a mythological divine tree, which fulfills all desires.

This model involves growing a variety of vegetables on the same farm. It aims for continuous supply of various types of vegetables, fulfilling nutritional requirements for families and providing a daily income to farmers through regular harvest.

The farmer’s selection of crops for their farm is often influenced by factors like crops grown traditionally in their region, technical knowledge of a particular crop, suitability to local agro-climatic conditions and most importantly, the market price.

Our wish list was to grow a diverse set of vegetables, which could be suitably grown in the local agro-climatic conditions. Vegetables are a very important part of Indian diets and farmers use a huge amount of agro-chemicals on vegetable farms.

We made a comprehensive list of vegetables that are suitable for the demo region. These are grown by farmers at present or were grown in the past.

Out of these crops, we finalised more than 20. These included coriander, fenugreek, bakla (broad beans), garlic, peas, radish, beetroot, turnip, French beans, amaranthus, carrot, spinach, sorrel, lettuce, mint, tomato, brinjal, chilli, cabbage, cauliflower and knol-khol.

Crop selection was also influenced by the availability of organic seeds.

Where are the organic seeds?

Having organic seed is the basic requirement of organic / natural farming. We were aware of the challenges in finding organic or traditional seeds, as this issue was repeatedly raised to us during our interactions with organic farmers.

But we found that the seeds available in the general market and also with the agriculture department were hybrids. We approached almost all the dealers and shops available in our locality for organic seeds and received the same response: No organic seeds were available.

People associated with the local agriculture department also confirmed that no organic seed is available with them.

We asked around for other seed shops in nearby towns or cities but to no avail.

We enquired with a few organic farmers in local regions but they also couldn’t provide us the needed seeds for some reason or the other. They told us that they were also struggling to find organic seeds and often had to travel long distances to gather these seeds.

After an exhaustive but unsuccessful hunt for local seeds in and around the region, we moved our search to Delhi, where the non-profit is headquartered.

We assumed that someone in the national capital would have the necessary seeds. The historic Roshanara Road, a popular vegetable market in North Delhi, is known as a hub for all types of seeds promoted by private companies.

We combed the market full of private seed dealers and wholesalers but found nothing in the name of ‘organic seed’.

Next, we approached the Indian Council of Agriculture Research (ICAR), Pusa, New Delhi. It is India’s premier body responsible for coordinating agricultural education and research in India.

The place designated for sourcing good quality seed is the seed development centre of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI) and the National Seeds Corporation Limited (NSCL) located in the same campus.

Not a single organic seed of vegetables was found at either places during our visit.

This was a big disappointment indeed, as the central and state governments are promoting organic / natural farming but their premier research institutes do not have organic seeds. Who else should we expect to keep them? How can we imagine promoting organic / natural farming in our country without providing the organic seeds to farmers? The reality felt too shocking and painful to accept.

But there is always a hope, especially with farmers and farmer-based organisations. The farmer-based Beej Bachao Andolan organisation in Uttarakhand provided us with organic seeds of chilli, tomato, bitter gourd, ridge gourd, pudina and spinach.

Similarly, Kheti Virasat Mission in Punjab that procure organic seeds from farmers also provided us seeds of coriander, ridge gourd, spinach, carrot, beans, fenugreek, turmeric, mustard, radish, flax seeds, peas and kasuri methi. We also got some seeds from our partner organisation CSA.

There are also farmer-based seed conservation organisations like Sahaj Samrudha in Karnataka but we wanted to stick to local organic seeds.

As organic seeds procured by us were from different agro-climatic conditions, we decided to procure open-pollinated seeds from the IARI and NSCL as well. These were chemically treated and so, we washed them properly before using them for sowing at our farm.

Only after procuring the seeds could we go ahead with the rest of the procedure. These included preparing the farms, testing the soil, choosing the package of practices and arranging for organic and biofertilisers.

The last three years were La Nina years whereas, the upcoming year is likely to be El Nino which not only makes summer harsher but also results in monsoon failure.

What are El Nino and La Nina?

El Nino and La Nina are two climate patterns. While El Nino is known for the abnormal warming of surface water in the eastern tropical pacific ocean whereas, La Nina results in the unusual cooling of the tropical eastern pacific.

In the El Nino effect, the sea surface temperature becomes much higher than normal. This temperature can be 4 to 5 degree Celsius higher than normal. El Nino is a part of the climate system. It has a profound effect on the weather. Due to its arrival, there is an effect on the weather all over the world.

In the La Nina effect, the sea surface temperature drops significantly. It has a direct effect on the temperature around the world and the temperature becomes colder than average. During this period in India, it is very cold and the rains are also moderate.

The duration of the La Nina event is between one to three years whereas, El Nino continues for less than a year.

Their impact on seasons in India

Due to this unusual warming and cooling of surface water, the monsoon in India is adversely affected. In intense La Nina, flood poses risk to crops whereas, in El Nino, the agriculture sector faces drought conditions.

For the past three years, Hyderabad along with other parts of the country was seeing chilly winter season and good monsoon due to La Nina, however, El Nino which is likely to be witnessed in the upcoming months may make summer hotter.

However, in the next few months, the city is likely to see rise in temperature. Even the monsoon season in the city is likely to be impacted due to the El Nino event.

In 2015, the El Nino event has significantly increased the temperature in the city during the summer.

The pest attack affected hundreds of farmers, especially tenant farmers, according to HRF and RSV.
Farmers in a viceOn an average, chilli farmers get a yield of 50 quintals in a one hectare (ha) area.
The need for compensating farmers is even more as chilli is a high investment crop with farmers investing around Rs 80,000-100,000 per acre.
A lot of these farmers are tenant farmers, who pay an additional lease amount of Rs 20,000-25,000 per acre.","There has been no announcement on compensation to farmers who have lost their crops

Twenty farmers have died by suicide since January 2022 in Telangana’s Mahabubad district after insect infestation destroyed their chilli crop, a ground survey by the Human Rights Forum (HRF) and Rythu Swarajya Vedika (RSV) has claimed. Five suicides have also been reported in Khammam district.

Thrips parvispinus, an invasive pest from Indonesia, has spread rapidly, especially in the two states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. Almost half of the total red chilli crop in Telangana has been affected, state government officials said.

The pest attack affected hundreds of farmers, especially tenant farmers, according to HRF and RSV.

Madhava Rao Gorepatti, president, Human Rights Forum, Telangana, told Down To Earth that all 20 suicides in Mahabubad took place within a two-month period because the farmers were in debt ranging from Rs 6-12 lakh.

“Most of the deaths were of tenant farmers. The lands taken on lease vary from 2-6 acres. The thrips disease roasts the entire crop,” Gorepatti added.

Around 40-80 per cent of the damage to the chilli crop in the two states was as a result of the pest invasion, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers’ Welfare, Narendra Singh Tomar told Parliament February 4, 2022,

Since Thrips parvispinus is an invasive pest species, it might have dominated / replaced the native chilli thrips, Scirtothrips dorsalis through competition, Tomar had said in his statement to Parliament.

Tomar had added that the change in weather / climatic conditions during the crop season might have favoured the establishment of the invasive species and thus resulted in its sudden upsurge.

The species, which was first reported in India in 2015, was also said to be carrying a virus which led to further spread of the disease. But not much is known about it.

“It has also spread to Karnataka, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra now,” an official from the horticulture department of Telangana, said.

Farmers in a vice

On an average, chilli farmers get a yield of 50 quintals in a one hectare (ha) area. They got less than half of this quantity after the pest attack. The quantity was just five quintals in one ha in many cases.

Hailstorms added to the losses already inflicted by the pest attack, affecting almost 8,100 ha in the state, a government official said.

But there has been no announcement on compensation to farmers who have lost their crops.

Telangana doesn’t have any crop insurance scheme of its own. It has already opted out from the Union government’s Pradhan Mantri Bima Fasal Yojana (PMFBY).

“The damage is also in Andhra Pradesh but there, the likelihood of getting some sort of relief either from PMFBY or other crop loss compensation is more as it has its own crop insurance scheme,” Kiran Kumar Vissa from RSV said.

He added that in Telangana, the government’s earlier promise of compensation after crop loss due to heavy rains in January has also not been fulfilled till now.

The need for compensating farmers is even more as chilli is a high investment crop with farmers investing around Rs 80,000-100,000 per acre.

“It is a very heavy loss. A lot of these farmers are tenant farmers, who pay an additional lease amount of Rs 20,000-25,000 per acre. They don’t get any bank loans and are completely indebted,” Vissa said.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-03-23/0.14952000_1648019838_chilli.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/telangana-farmers-pushed-to-suicide-after-pest-attack-destroys-chilli-crop-82043

The ministry claimed that 92% of the area of the bio-decomposer spread plots was not burnt in 2021.In this context, Tomar appealed to farmers to use bio-decomposer in a big way saying it would not only solve the problem of stubble burning but also increase fertility of the cultivable land. Besides, he said, a comprehensive solution to this problem is possible with optimum utilization of 2.07 lakh machines made available to the states for stubble management.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-95314893,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg",[],https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lets-look-for-solutions-together-says-union-agriculture-minister-narendra-singh-tomar-on-stubble-burning/articleshow/95314806.cms

The agrarian state had steadfastly refused to join the scheme, citing assured irrigation of the state’s agriculture fields.
We are currently working out the modalities for joining the crop insurance scheme,” Singh told FE.
In February 2020, the government made the PMFBY voluntary for farmers; previously, it was mandatory for farmers to take insurance cover under the scheme.
Sources said consultations with all the stakeholders are currently in progress and the revamped PMFBY will help widen the crop insurance cover for farmers.","The Punjab government is set to join Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) from the next crop year (2023-24). What prompted the state government, which hasn’t adopted the scheme launched in 2016, to change its stance is large-scale damage to crops in the last two seasons due to adverse weather conditions and past attack.

The agrarian state had steadfastly refused to join the scheme, citing assured irrigation of the state’s agriculture fields.

Punjab’s move comes after several states such as Telangana, Bihar, Jharkhand and Gujarat, which had dropped out of the crop insurance scheme citing the high cost of premium, have initiated discussion with the Centre to roll out PMFBY by next year.

Gurvinder Singh, Director, Department of Agriculture, Punjab said that in the last two years the state government has paid around Rs 1000 crore to the farmers as compensation because of damage to cotton crop from pink bollworm pests and unseasonal rains.

We are currently working out the modalities for joining the crop insurance scheme,” Singh told FE. He said that through joining the scheme, the financial burden for providing compensation to the farmers could be reduced.

Under the heavily-subsidised PMFBY, the premium to be paid by farmers is fixed at just 1.5% of the sum insured for rabi crops and 2% for kharif crops, while it is 5% for cash crops. The balance premium is equally shared among the Centre and states and in the case of the northeastern states, the premium is split between the Centre and states in a 9:1 ratio.

Also Read: Rs 32,500 cr transferred to states as capex loan

In July, the Andhra Pradesh government announced its decision to re-join the PMFBY, effective kharif 2022, after the Centre agreed to the state government’s proposal of universalising the scheme for all the farmers.

In February 2020, the government made the PMFBY voluntary for farmers; previously, it was mandatory for farmers to take insurance cover under the scheme. The scheme is currently being implemented in 21 states/Union territories.

A delay by the Telangana government in releasing its share of premium under the PMFBY, in 2018-19 and 2019-20, led to the Centre stopping the release of its component of a matching sum, thus leading to delay in claim settlement for the farmers. Subsequently, the Telangana government stopped implementing the PMFBY from the 2020 kharif season.

Meanwhile, the government is considering a slew of proposals to revamp PMFBY by next year, following a sharp drop in claims to premium ratio, rise in premium rates pushing subsidy liability of the government. Sources said consultations with all the stakeholders are currently in progress and the revamped PMFBY will help widen the crop insurance cover for farmers.

Among the likely changes are a higher claim-premium cap of 130% from 110% now – a move aimed at infusing fresh life into the scheme.

According to an analysis by a working group set up by the agriculture ministry, since 2016, PMFBY premium has increased by more than six-fold, which has led to an increase in subsidy liability of the government.",https://www.financialexpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1-100.jpg,[],https://www.financialexpress.com/economy/punjab-to-join-crop-insurance-scheme/2806645/

The exhibition was inaugurated by Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, Kailash Chowdhary.

Lalchand Kataria, Minister of Agriculture and Animal Husbandry, Government of Rajasthan, and Udayalal Anjana, Minister of State, Cooperation Department, Government of Rajasthan were also present at the inauguration ceremony. Apart from the senior officials from the Central Government, State Government, and Indian Council of Agricultural Research and around 15,000 farmers, Agri startups, corporate bankers, extension workers, and employees of private agricultural institutions participated on the first day of the event.

Samuel Praveen Kumar, Joint Secretary (Extension), Department of Agriculture & Farmers Welfare, Government of India delivered the welcome address. Dinesh Kumar, Principal Secretary (Agriculture), Government of Rajasthan shared the details of the program.

Lok Sabha Speaker Shri Om Birla said that India is an agricultural country. Our country is at the forefront of food production. In the changing agricultural landscape, we should resolve to use contemporary practices, and using innovation, we should aim to become a frontline country in the world. He said that AatmaNirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India) will be realized when our farmers use new agricultural practices, innovation, value addition, more crop per drop, etc. Om Birla stressed the use of horticulture, startups, and drones. He said that through Startups, we have worked to bring down production costs in some instances, and in other cases, we have increased production, at some places we have set up food processing units, and at other places, we have achieved value addition.

Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, Kailash Chowdhary, while addressing the farmers, said that keeping in view the global scenario of the agriculture sector, the Department of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has implemented several important schemes for the progress of Indian agriculture. This is proof of dedication towards farmers and efforts being made to increase their income. An unprecedented increase has been made in the budgetary allocation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare. The combined budget allocation of the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying in the year 2013-14 was Rs 30,223.88 crore, which has been hiked by more than 4.59 times to Rs 1,38,920.93 crore in the year 2022-23.

Lalchand Kataria, Agriculture and Animal Husbandry Minister, Government of Rajasthan said that to improve the financial condition of the farmer, there is a need for new technology, innovation, animal husbandry, and traditional farming, all of which have been displayed here. Through the startups, farmers will get information about how to store, how to do farming with less water, and how to plough the field at less cost.

Udayalal Anjana, Minister of State, Cooperative Department, Government of Rajasthan said that both Agriculture Department and Cooperative Department are complementary to each other. Farmers should be educated by organizing such fairs, which will strengthen their economic condition. Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and Minister of State for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare, Government of India, Shri Kailash Choudhary also inaugurated the drone demonstration by flying the drone themselves.

In this exhibition, 150 stalls have been set up to provide farmers with updated information related to agriculture. Keeping in view the important role of startups in the field of agriculture, 75 stalls of Startups have been set up in this exhibition, which is one of the main features of the exhibition. Information about the schemes being run by the Central and State Governments for the farmers is being provided through the various stalls set up in the exhibition. Along with this, private sector companies/organizations related to the supply of various inputs for agriculture have also displayed their products.

After the formal inauguration of the two-day agriculture festival, exhibition, and training program, parallel farmer training sessions were organized in three training rooms on modern and scientific agricultural techniques on the subjects of agriculture, horticulture, animal husbandry, and dairying. Two training programs each were organized in all three auditoriums this afternoon. Farmers were taught the nuances of remunerative farming by various subject experts. Six training programs were organized on the contribution of Quality Seeds in crop production, advanced cultivation of guava and amla in Farmers Producer Organization Kisan Bazar, Kota division, Climate Smart Farming Practices, Sheep Farming for additional income and importance and use of Nano Urea in Sustainable Farming, etc.

Hanamkonda: The official machinery in the district is all set to procure two lakh tonnes of paddy against the expected yield of 3.18 lakh tonnes from the Vanakalam crop. While it was decided to set up a total of 161 paddy purchase centres (PPCs) in the district, 23 of them were already started in Kamalapur and Elkathurhy mandal, officials of the Civil Supplies Corporation said.

Primary Agriculture Cooperative Societies (PACS), and Self-Help Groups (SHGs) are going to set up these centres for the benefit of the farmers.

Training for purchase centres’ managers has already been completed, and 16 lakh gunny bags have been made available for the purchase. Another 10 lakh bags will be sent to the purchase centres soon as and when they are opened.

The minimum support price (MSP) for common variety paddy is Rs 2,040 per quintal while that for the ‘A’ grade variety is Rs 2,060 per quintal. The government has made all arrangements to ensure crediting the amount to farmers’ bank accounts within two days of completion of the process of purchasing.

Meanwhile, tenders for lorry transport to move paddy from purchase centers to the godowns has also been completed. Officials of the Civil Supplies Department are suggesting the to follow the quality standards to get the best price. “Farmers should dry the paddy after harvesting and ensure that the moisture content should remain lower than 17 percent, that the waste, ‘tar’, clay and stones should not exceed one percent of the total paddy and that the damaged, discolored, sprouted, insect-prone paddy should not exceed five percent.

Venkat Reddy, a farmer from Damera village of Elkaturthy mandal, said that paddy harvesting would get momentum in a week.

While the Odisha Millet Mission was launched to promote seven millet crops, ragi dominates production and procurement (Photo courtesy: Collector and DM, Sundargarh)

Supply creates its own demand. This theory, believed to have been proposed by the early 19th century French economist Jean-Baptiste Say, may sound like a foolhardy view to the modern ear, but this is how India lost the diversity of its food basket to the Green Revolution.

In the 1960s, as the country was struggling to feed itself, the focus was to rapidly increase the production of two crops — wheat and rice. This shaped an Indian diet where rice and wheat became the staple food, eventually reducing the demand for other traditional cereal grains like millets.

Assessments in recent decades show that while the Green Revolution has not helped address the nutritional security of India, it has turned the country into the world’s biggest extractor of groundwater. Heavy reliance on chemical inputs has degraded soil, polluted water sources and is harming farmers’ health.

Fifty years later, as Odisha tries to improve nutritional security and promote sustainable agricultural practices, Say’s law has come in handy.

In 2017, the state launched the Odisha Millet Mission (OMM), which aims to bring millets back to its fields and food plates by encouraging farmers to grow the crops that traditionally formed a substantial part of the diet and crop system in tribal areas.

This highly varied group of small-seeded cereal crops not only require less water, farm inputs and are more resilient to climate vulnerability, but rich in nutrients like calcium, iron and protein.

Better for the food plate

The Green Revolution has largely focused on production and consumption of wheat and paddy. However, in terms of nutritional value, millets will prove to be more beneficial

OMM provides farmers incentives of up to Rs 9,500 per ha over a three-year period to shift to millet cultivation.

This includes free seeds and organic fertilisers. Public-policy think tanks Watershed Support Services and Activities Network (WASSAN) headquartered in Hyderabad and the Nabakrushna Choudhury Centre for Development Studies (NCDS) based in Bhubaneswar, which have partnered with the state government for the mission, conduct regular training programmes for farmers to improve productivity and lower input costs.

To complete the supply chain, the government has created an assured market for the produce. Hiranjan Mohanta, joint director of agriculture for Odisha, says that since 2019, the state has been offering minimum support price of Rs 3,377 per 100 kg of ragi, more than the Rs 1,940 per 100 kg for paddy. It has benchmarked prices for little millet and foxtail millet and developed an automated portal for procurement.

Over the past five years, Odisha has recorded a 14-fold increase in millet production, from 3,333 hectares (ha) in 2017-18 to 53,230 ha in 2021-22. Even the average yield has improved by 28 per cent because of sustainable agricultural practices and quality seeds.

In 2018, NCDS conducted a survey of households growing millets under the mission, and found that the value of their produce per ha doubled from Rs 9,477 to Rs 20,701 and income per ha increased from Rs 3,957 to Rs 12,486.

To ensure that the millets reach the food plates, the government conducts regular campaigns and rallies to make people aware of the benefits of millets and to remove the notion that they are poor people’s food, says Dinesh Balam, associate director, WASSAN.

The government has also made it part of the public distribution system (PDS) and provides 1 kg of ragi per ration card holder, which can increase to 2 kg in areas with high ragi procurement. In Keonjhar and Sundargarh districts, a ragi laddu mix is distributed by anganwadi centres for consumption by young children.

OMM has earned accolades for its agro-ecological initiatives from various national and international agencies, including UN. In 2021, NITI Aayog, think tank of the Union government, said it will facilitate OMM’s learnings in other states.

To assess the impact of the mission on the ground, researchers with Delhi-based Centre for Science and Environment travelled this May to various districts of the state. They found that while there has been an increase in overall production and consumption of millets in the state, the crops have not yet regained their earlier glory.

Shoots of growth

In the first five years of implementation, Odisha Millet Mission has increased production and consumption of millets to some extent. However, to scale up, it must recognise its shortcomings

measures to boost production measures to boost consumption Incentives of Rs 9,500 per hectare over a three-year period Campaigns, training and food festivals to promote millets Capacity-building through training on millet production, application of biological inputs and sowing techniques Setting up of mobile vans or trucks, cafés, kiosks and

outlets to sell millet-based foods Procurement of ragi at higher minimum support price than that of paddy Creation of “Millet Shakti” brand to sell products like cookies, savoury snacks, vermicelli and processed millets Facilitation of market linkages by farmer-producer organisations Under the public distribution system, one ration card holder gets 1-2 kg of ragi, depending on the procurement. Ragi laddu mix is provided by anganwadi centres in two districts Impacts Shortcomings 19 of 30 districts covered, comprising 142 blocks, 1,722 gram panchayats, 16,989 villages, and 129,222 farmers Nine districts have less than 5 per cent of farmers’ coverage. Only 1.54 per cent of total net sown area covered Value of produce per hectare in households increased from Rs 9,477 per ha to R20,701; income from R3,957 to R12,486 Focus has largely been on production and procurement of ragi rather than all kinds of millets Increased income for women’s self help groups involved in processing and sale of millet products Numbers of sales outlets are still low. Scale of Millet Shakti and public distribution is extremely limited Share of farmer households consuming millets in the winter has increased to 98.5 per cent, in the rainy season to

72.6 per cent and in summer to 89.9 per cent. Only 500 kg of millets are procured at assured prices. Farmers resort to the open market to sell produce they do not or cannot consume at low prices of R10-12 per kg

Much to be desired

OMM promotes production and consumption of seven millets. But so far, focus has been on ragi, which has accounted for 86 per cent of the total area under millets, according to data on the OMM website. In contrast, little millet, foxtail millet, sorghum, pearl millet, kodo millet and barnyard millet cover less than 13 per cent of the area.

Explaining the mission’s focus on ragi, Kalpana Pradhan, scheme officer of the mission, says, “We are looking for high-yielding seeds for non-ragi millets. Farmers are urged to plant some non-ragi millets.”

In 2020-21, the state government procured slightly more than 20 million kg of ragi. However, this accounts for only 27 per cent of the total ragi produced, as OMM procures only 500 kg of ragi per ha and leaves the rest for farmers to consume.

This practice has prompted farmers to consume more millets in all seasons, shows a mid-term evaluation by NCDS in 2019-20. But given that average yield is 1,500 kg per ha, much of the produce does not get procured and farmers are forced to sell it at distressed rate. Damroodhar Jani, from Ranga Paru village in Kandhamal district says, “We get Rs 10-12 per kg in the open market.”

OMM officials also admit that despite ragi being distributed in PDS and as a mix through anganwadi centres in two districts, its consumption has not picked up in a significant manner.

OMM also sells millet products, such as cookies, savoury snacks, vermicelli and processed millets, under a brand called “Millet Shakti” through food trucks, cafés, kiosks and other outlets.

“Women self-help groups (SHGs) have been kept at the centre of the programme. They do not just pay a major role in manufacturing biological inputs to improve millet yields and undertake processing of the produce, but also operate the millet-based cafés and outlets,” says Kalpana.

The full potential of SHGs, though, has not yet been realised. So far, only three women’s SHGs manufacture and process Millet Shakti products, which limits the volume available, income generated, and consumption.

OMM also leverages farmer-producer organisations (FPOs) to provide better marketing linkages.

Until now, OMM has tapped into existing FPOs to sell processed millets in the open market or aggregate produce for Tribal Development Co-operative Corporation of Odisha Limited; if a block does not have an FPO, an SHG or community group is registered as one.

Currently, there are 76 FPOs under OMM. But some of them are engaged only in minor processing and aggregation, without plans of scaling up market linkages. Encouraging FPOs with better incentives and benefit-sharing will help them compete in the market, says Sanghamitra Pradhan, scheme officer from Gajapati district.

FPOs also have their limitations, says M Muthu Kumar, OMM director. “To make farmers self-sustainable regardless of OMM, it is critical that we create a parallel market for millets. We are in discussions to get private firms such as Reliance Group involved,” he adds.

For the next five years, Odisha has set targets like revival of millet foods in urban and rural areas, covering 1,000-2,000 ha and 4,000 households in each block under improved agricultural practices, and supporting 142 FPOs for marketing and exports. To meet them, it must recognise its shortcomings.

The programme’s coverage has increased from 14 districts in 2017 to 19 districts now. But data is available only for 15 districts, nine of which have less than 5 per cent of farmers under OMM, covering 1.54 per cent of the total net sown area.

There is no information on the exact production of millets other than ragi. Understanding these trends will help develop better strategies for production, marketing support and consumption. For instance, the government can expand distribution of millets in more districts and include it in midday meals offered in schools to provide a major consumption boost.

Umi Daniel, director of migration and education at development non-profit Action Education (previously known as Aide et Action)-South Asia, who is based in Bhubaneswar, says, “Millets have been grown and consumed by indigenous people for a long time. The decline of the crops was not just due to the Green Revolution, but also because non-tribal people did not accept them.”

“The government is once again aggressively marketing millets in tribal areas, which may stereotype them as tribal or poor people’s food and drive young tribal people away,” he adds.

In moderate and high emissions scenarios, the report projected a warming of 1-2.5°C for the summer months in a majority of districts in 2030s.
By the end of the century, the report projected an approximate rise of 4.4 degrees Celsius in a high emissions scenario.
It also projected a rise in extreme rainfall events.
An increase of 25-35% in rainfall is projected for only a few districts in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Bihar.","Peak summer temperatures in over two-thirds of India’s districts rose by up to 0.9°C between 1990 and 2019, according to a new study that warned of these trends being exacerbated due to climate change, which will also lead to more extreme weather events. Representational Image (Raj K Raj/HT PHOTO)

Precisely, the study found that average maximum temperatures between March and May rose by up to 0.9°C in 2019 in 70% of the districts in 28 states, when compared to 1990.

The results were published on Friday in a report, titled “Climate Atlas of India: District-Level Analysis of Historical and Projected Climate Change Scenarios”, which also warned of a rise in extreme weather events, particularly spells of heavy rain, if global emissions are not curbed.

The assessment provides a rare and granular look at how and where the climate crisis is unfolding in India, identifying districts where summers were harsher, winters warmer and the monsoon rainier than before. Based on these, it predicted a “warmer and wetter future” for almost the whole of India in the short term future between 2021 and 2050, a period it called as the 2030s.

The researchers did so by analysing historical trends in summer maximum and winter minimum temperatures, and rainfall in the three decades between 1990 and 2019.

In the winter months of December to February, the average minimum temperatures rose by up to 0.5°C in 54% of the districts in the three-decade period. There was more monsoon rain over most districts, but the north-east and Western Ghats recording the highest increase of about 10-15%.

The projected changes in climate across the country could adversely impact water, agriculture, forest and biodiversity, and health and infrastructure, the report said.

In moderate and high emissions scenarios, the report projected a warming of 1-2.5°C for the summer months in a majority of districts in 2030s. In the winter months, a warming of over 1°C is projected.

A warming of 1 to 1.5°C is projected for 72% of India’s districts, 1.5 to 2°C for 15% of the districts, 2 to 2.5°C for 2% of the districts, and 1°C for 11% of the districts.

According to the report, districts in Manipur were at the highest risk of warming with a maximum rise of 2 to 2.5°C in districts such as Bishnupur, Churachandpur, Chandel, and Noney in a moderate emission scenario up to 2030s.

The ministry of earth sciences, in a report in 2020, found that India’s average temperature rose by around 0.7 degrees Celsius between 1901 and 2019. By the end of the century, the report projected an approximate rise of 4.4 degrees Celsius in a high emissions scenario.

It also projected a rise in extreme rainfall events.

The CSTEP report has projected monsoon rain to increase by 25-35% in 2% of India’s districts, 15-25% in 18% of districts, and 10-15% in 35% of the districts relative to the 1990-2019 period.

In the remaining 45% of the districts, less than 10% change in rainfall is projected.

An increase of 25-35% in rainfall is projected for only a few districts in Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, and Bihar. An increase of 15-25% is projected for only a few districts in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Manipur, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh, and Bihar.

A projection of temperatures in 2030s predicted a likely increase in the number of heatwaves, or days with a 4.5 to 6.4 degrees Celsius departure from normal temperatures under both moderate and high emissions scenarios.

Some districts, such Gorakhpur, Chandrapur, Hissar, Ludhiana, Raipur, Sambalpur, are also likely to experience a spike in both heat waves and severe heat waves, the report said.

An increase in high-intensity rainfall events is projected for most of the districts of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Odisha, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh in a moderate emissions scenario, and an increase in very high intensity rainfall events is projected for few districts of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Telangana, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Himachal Pradesh.

Changes in rainfall patterns could affect surface and groundwater availability with several implications, including water for irrigation, the report said.

“Agriculture crops have specific temperature and water requirements during various growth phases; an increase in temperature impacts yields. Livestock health and productivity are adversely impacted. Extreme hot weather and heatwaves lead to exhaustion and heat strokes and worsen chronic health conditions in humans,” the report said.

Calling for a review of the impact of warming on the agriculture sector, M Rajeevan, former secretary, ministry of earth sciences, said, “It is important to prepare for warming particularly in the agriculture sector.

With the incessant rains in the past couple of days many streams and tanks were overflowing in both the districts. A heavy rainfall of 11.9 cm and 8.3 cm was recorded at Mandalapalli and Naidupeta of Dammapet mandal in Kothagudem district.

Gangaram of Sathupalli mandal in Khammam district received 7.5 cm rainfall while six mandals in the district received above 5cm rainfall. As a result many low lying areas in Khammam city and other mandals were inundated with rainwater.

Transportation between Penuballi and Gangapadu villages in Penuballi was affected due to rains. Similarly 15 villages in Gundala and Allapalli mandals were cut off from the outside world as Kinnerasani, Kodipunjula, Mallanna and other streams were overflowing.

With Buggavagu overflowing on Lingala-Dornakal road vehicular traffic was stopped on Khammam-Dornakal road. Same situation prevailed in Aswaraopet and Dammapet mandals while Mallaiahkunta tank at Mushtibanda breached in Dammapet mandal inundating around 100 acres of paddy fields in its vicinity.

Meanwhile, coal production and overburden removal work in SCCL’s opencast mines at Sathupalli, Yellandu, Kothagudem and Manugur areas was affected due to waterlogging in the mines.

Irrigation officials lifted 23 gates at Taliperu medium irrigation project in Cherla mandal for free flow on Monday discharging 77, 605 cusecs of excess water downstream as the reservoir was receiving 78, 409 cusecs inflow due to rainfall in its catchment area.

Three gates of Kinnerasani reservoir at Paloncha were lifted to discharge 18, 000 cusecs excess water. People living in the villages on the banks of Taliperu and Kinnerasani were alerted in view of water release. The water level in river Godavari at Bhadrachalam at 12 noon was 36.10 feet with a discharge of 6,22,233 cusecs.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Khammam-projects.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/incessant-rains-affect-normal-life-coal-production-and-agriculture-activity-in-khammam

The visitors were shown 15 types of green leaves found in agricultural fields. The farmers highlighted the importance of green leaves in the diet.

Later, they were taken to Machanur where the DDS had put an exhibition with 50 kinds of uncultivated green leaves. The visitors were served tumultuous lunch made with different kinds of green leaves. The visitors and farmers shared their experiences during a brief meeting. DDS director P V Sathish said that the farmers were forced to use fertilizer and pesticides in cultivation.

However, Sathish said that the uncultivated green leaves found in the agricultural fields and wild will grow in an organic way. DDS farmer Mogulamma said that they will use no fertiliser or pesticide except for cattle dung. She said that she will find over 60 kinds of uncultivated green leaves.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/greens-festival.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/greens-festival-at-zaheerabad

In 2022, India recorded its hottest March. This triggered an early onslaught of heat waves that engulfed several states across North, Central and East India from March-May this year, according to a new publication.

Heat-wave like conditions prevailed in 16 states of India from March 11-April 24, 2022, stated State of India’s Environment In figures, 2022 (SoE in figures, 2022).

The country reported 280 heat wave days from March 11-May 18, 2022 — the highest in 12 years, it said. While IMD releases heatwave days for individual states every year, the book has added them up to reach the India figure. This has been done to make the numbers comparable. For example: In 2011, heatwaves were reported in Andhra Pradesh (8), Rajasthan (7), Punjab (6), Haryana and Tamil Nadu (3 each), Madhya Pradesh, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh (2 each), and Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Maharashtra and West Bengal (1 each). They add to 40 heatwave days for India.

The annual publication by Down To Earth magazine of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a Delhi-based non-profit, analysed data released by the India Meteorological Department (IMD).

This seventh edition of the annual e-book was released at an online event June 2, 2022 by Sunita Narain, director-general, CSE and editor of DTE.

Heat waves on land and depressions in the sea this year began early in and around India on March 11, 2022.

The country’s hazard atlas launched by the IMD in 2021 has not considered March while providing heat waves data. The IMD dashboard has provided figures on “heat waves” for the months of April to July only. This is an indicator that “heat waves” in March, 2022 are “not normal”

This is almost double of what the country experienced in 2012, the second-highest heat wave year in the past decade, according to the publication.

A heat wave occurs when the temperature crosses 40 degrees Celsius in the plains, 37°C in the coastal areas and 30°C in the hills, according to IMD.

Heat wave is declared on the day an area records temperatures 4.5-6.4°C above normal. When temperatures rise more than 6.4°C above normal, it is classified as a ‘severe’ heat wave, according to IMD.

More than half heat waves in 5 states

Five states accounted for 54 per cent of the heat waves this year. These were Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Gujarat and Haryana, according to SoE in figures, 2022.

Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jammu & Kashmir — all in the Himalayan regions — have been unusually warm this year, according to the e-book.

HP recorded 27 heat wave days, Rajasthan 39 and Madhya Pradesh 38.

Climate change link

The unusual heatwaves in March 2022 could be due to an unexpected climate anomaly, which could be linked to global warming, alerted Down To Earth based on its interaction with experts in March 2022

April was the hottest month for northwest and central India and the third-hottest April the country has seen in the past 122 years (1901 to 2022), IMD had analysed.

Such unusual, early heat waves which swept India and Pakistan in 2022 were made 30 times more likely due to the direct impact of climate change, claimed a recent global study by World Weather Attribution Network (WWAN).

These heat waves pose a major risk to public health and at least 90 deaths were recorded in the two countries (India and Pakistan), stated the global study based on media reports.

Heatwaves are termed the “silent disaster” as heat-related deaths are often undercounted around the world for a number of reasons, wrote WWAN in its study.

So, these are likely to be under-estimates as at least 39 deaths due to heat wave were reported from just 5 states — Maharashtra (26), Jharkhand (2), Odisha (6), Rajasthan (2) and Telangana(2) as of May 3, 2022.

Climate change is rapid, widespread and irreversible, alerted Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its sixth assessment report. The severity and frequency of extreme events will increase in a warming world, including India, CSE reminded in its annual book.

Such events can make the elderly and residents of low-income areas more vulnerable, another study published in the journal Earth’s Future had noted.

When extreme events including heat waves are set to increase in severity and frequency, the poor in informal housing, including the slum dwellers, will suffer the most.

Affordable housing projects fail to comply with the latest energy code, according to a CSE analysis.

This reminds of the urgency to incorporate heat-resilient, affordable housing as an integral element of “urban planning”.

in 16 of the 56 cities analysed by SoE In figures, 2022, one out of every four residents lives in slums. These include three capital cities Raipur, Hyderabad , Mumbai

More than 50 per cent of the population in India depends on agriculture for their livelihoods. Agriculture is also the 3rd most significant contributor to our GDP and will always attract attention in the Union Budget 2023.

However, unlike previous years, we are moving into 2023-24 with a cautious and uncertain outlook owing to challenges like a looming recession, the Russia-Ukraine war, threats of climate change, falling export numbers, global inflation in crude, edible oil, and wheat prices. A separate budget allocation to improve crop production efficiency and enhancement of the supply chain can improve benefits to the farmers.

Supporting technology adoption and digitisation of agriculture

Technology interventions, mechanisation, GIS, internet of things (IoT), artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data, blockchain and drones can act as critical drivers to propel growth, farm efficiency, and improve production efficiency at scale. The government can expand the existing measures like Digital Agriculture Mission (2021-2025) to include these technological interventions that help deliver market and mandi prices, supply chain visibility and food security.

Furthermore, the government should support the creation of an open ag ecosystem that acts as a public data library wherein all parties can share and access information and insights around soil health, pests and diseases to help fast-track the change. The government can look to promote and open opportunities for PPP (public-private partnerships) to improve accessibility and truly bring in digitisation at the grassroots level.

Incentives and investments to solve climate change

A clear definition of climate change needs to be drafted. The Union Budget 2023 should give special impetus on incentives and tax benefits for domestic companies that focus on solving climate change. There is a need to create a well-regulated voluntary carbon markets framework with policies and incentives that help India meet its Net Zero goals. Policies that encourage farmers to implement sustainable and precision farming practices can be drafted and implemented. Financial benefits and subsidies for the farmers set aside by the government can be routed via agritech companies and organisations promoting sustainable agricultural practices at a grassroot level to propel a shift towards climate-smart farming practices at scale.

Solving market linkage challenges

The key objective of introducing the Farmers Produce Trade and Commerce Act 2020 was to facilitate agricultural produce trade outside APMCs (Agricultural Produce Market Committees) mandis. However, measures are yet to be taken to allow trade based on the PAN card outside APMCs. Furthermore, despite the government allocating funds to improve the infrastructure at APMCs for installing testing and drying machines, the availability of these machines could be much higher.

Similarly, increasing the number of APMCs, introducing digital platforms to help farmers sell produce at a fair price, delivering market price information, and regularly offering advisory, financial assistance, and best practices. Setting up marketplaces focused on farmer producer organisations (FPOs) can also help drive demand and improve farmers’ price realisations. The industry is looking for rational reforms in the Union Budget.

HYDERABAD: Soybean, which is fondly referred to as the ‘yellow gold,’ is one wonder crop which has seen an extension in its area of cultivation from 30,000 hectares in the 1970s, to a remarkable 12.95 million hectares in the country presently. It is the fourth largest crop grown in India and second largest in terms of yield in the country.

However, while its productivity has increased by 50 per cent in countries like US and Argentina where it is largely grown, in India its yield has remained constant, much below those countries. Scientists are suggesting investment in research and development to find ways to increase its productivity, and to appreciate germ plasm superiority, even it means going for genetically modified or gene-edited varieties.

A book titled Economics and Technology of Soybean Cultivation in Central India written by E Revathy and B Suresh Reddy of Centre for Social and Economic Studies (CESS) was released on Saturday, followed by a panel discussion on the subject.

In his initial remarks, Ramesh Chand, member of Niti Aayog, termed soybean as the only green revolution success in rainfed agriculture, and that its advancement in growth rate has been more than paddy and wheat.

He said that the first time (with the native black seed variety being an exception) soybean was introduced in India from Mississippi and saw a large-scale expansion because of the initial superiority of its germ plasm. It was being grown in Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and in some parts of Karnataka and Maharashtra, displacing crops like millets and cotton.

Though 40.9 million tonne soybean was harvested in 2013, he said its yield started declining since then. While the world average yield was 1,900 kg/hectare and the US average has been 2,850 kg/hectare, India’s average was 1,000 kg/hectare in 1990. While the world average and US average yield has increased by 50 per cent by 2020, India’s average yield has not increased.

R Jagadeeshwar, Director of Research, PJTSAU, opined that climate change, untimely supply of quality seeds, and other factors resulted in soybean cultivation going from 2.43 lakh acres in 2014, to 1.4 lakh acres in Telangana presently.

This pushed many African households away from subsistence farming and the production of food for local markets

Zawadi Msafiri is seen in a withered maize crop field in Kilifi County, Kenya. The drought situation started in 2021

In the waning hours of the year’s biggest climate change conference — COP27 — we learned of a deal to create a loss and damage fund. This is essentially a source of finance to compensate poor countries for the pain they are incurring because of climate change. An often-cited example of such suffering is the ongoing drought in the Horn of Africa region, which has put some 22 million people at risk of severe hunger.

While some have heralded this agreement as long overdue climate reparations, others point out that the loss and damage fund does nothing to address the root causes of climate change — fossil fuel emissions.

Here I seek to raise a different concern: this approach glosses over the fact that the types of food production systems that the global community has fostered in Africa leave the poorest more exposed and vulnerable to climatic variability and economic shocks. These food production systems refer to the ways people produce, store, process and distribute food, as well as the inputs into the system along the way.

Historically smallholder and women farmers have produced the lion’s share of food crops on the African continent. Over the past 60 years, global decision makers, big philanthropy, business interests and large swaths of the scientific community have focused on increased food production, trade, and energy intensive farming methods as the best way to address global and African hunger.

This approach to addressing hunger has failed to address food insecurity on the continent. Moderate to severe food insecurity affects nearly 60 per cent of Africans today. It’s also resulted in food systems that are now more vulnerable to climate change.

The idea that the solution is to produce more dates back to the colonial period. It’s bad for the global environment, highly vulnerable to climate and energy shocks, and does not feed the poorest of the poor.

I approach this topic as a nature-society geographer who has spent his career studying agricultural development approaches and food systems in west and southern Africa. Through this work, I have come to see agroecology as more accessible to the poorest.

Vulnerable food systems

Each time there has been a global food crisis, variations on the formula of increased agricultural production, trade and energy intensive farming methods have been the favoured solution.

These include the first Green Revolution of the 1960s-1970s, commodity production and trade in the 1980s-1990s, the New Green Revolution for Africa and public-private partnerships in the 2000s-2010s.

Many scholars now understand that food security has six dimensions, of which only one is addressed by food production.

Looking at all six dimensions reveals the complex drivers of hunger. These include:

food availability — local production and net imports

access — the ability of households to acquire food that is available

utilisation — the cooking, water and sanitation facilities needed to prepare healthy food

stability of food prices and supplies over time

sustainability — the ability to produce food without undermining the resource base

agency — people’s ability to control their food systems, from production to consumption.

Decolonising African agriculture

So, how did we get here?

Certain countries and businesses profit from productionist approaches to addressing hunger. These include, for example, Monsanto, which developed the herbicide Round-Up. Or the four companies (Archer-Daniels-Midland, Bunge, Cargill and Louis Dreyfus) that control 70 per cent-90 per cent of the global grain trade.

The productionist focus is also engrained in the agricultural sciences. Tropical agronomy, now known as “development agronomy”, was central to the colonial enterprise in Africa.

The main objective for colonial powers was to transform local food systems. This pushed many African households away from subsistence farming and the production of food for local markets.

Instead, they moved towards the cultivation of commodity crops needed to fuel European economic expansion, such as cotton in Mali, coffee in Kenya, and cacao in Côte d'Ivoire.

While forced labour was employed in some instances, head taxes became the preferred strategy in many cases for facilitating commodity crop production. Forced to pay such taxes in cash or face jail time, African farmers begrudgingly started to produce cash crops, or went to work on nearby plantations.

Loss of risk management practices

Accompanying the transition to commodity crop production was a gradual loss of risk management practices like storage of surplus grain. Many farmers and herders in Africa have had to deal with highly variable rainfall patterns for centuries.

This makes them some of the foremost experts on climate change adaptation. Farmers would also plant a diverse range of crops with different rainfall requirements. Herders moved across large areas in search of the best pastures.

In the name of progress, colonial regimes often encouraged herders to be less mobile throughout East Africa. They also pushed farmers via taxation policies to store less grain in order to maximise commodity crop production. This opened up farmers to the full, deadly force of extended droughts, a situation that is well documented in northern Nigeria.

Many problematic approaches have continued in the post-colonial period.

Various international and national policies and programmes have encouraged African farmers to produce more crops, using imported seeds, pesticides and fertilisers in the name of development or hunger alleviation.

Even though African farmers may be producing more, they are left exposed to the ravages of variable climatic conditions.

Agroecology and the way forward

Agroecologists can offer a different way forward. They seek to understand the ecological interactions between different crops, crops and the soil and atmosphere, and crops and insect communities. They seek to maintain soil fertility, minimise predation from pests and grow more crops without using chemical inputs.

Agroecologists often collaborate with and learn from farmers who have developed such practices over time and are in tune with local ecologies. This combination of experiential knowledge and formal science training makes agroecology a more decolonial science. It is also more accessible to the poor because there’s no need to buy expensive inputs or risk becoming indebted when crops fail.

The fact that agroecological farming is less expensive has not been lost on the business community. They would lose out substantially if conventional farming approaches were no longer associated with hunger alleviation.

Furthermore, those in the agricultural sciences who have supported productionist approaches to hunger alleviation also see agroecology as a threat as it could lead to a decline of prestige and research funding.

There are signs that the global community may be on the cusp of a major shift in thinking with regard to food systems, climate change and hunger.

A global food crisis has led some to question why previous solutions have not worked. We also now have an emerging, more decolonial science of agroecology that is increasingly accepted within the United Nations system.

It’s backed by a powerful social movement that refused to back down when corporate agricultural interests tried to hijack the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit.

In some cases, there are also large institutional donors experimenting with agroecological approaches, something almost unheard of a decade ago.

Lastly, there is a new set of leaders within some African governments who understand what agroecology offers.

The ravages of climate change and hunger do not occur in isolation, but are part of the system we have built. That means we can build something different. The current crisis lays bare this problem and the right combination of new ideas, resources and political will can solve it.

The multidimensional interventions focus on reducing vulnerability while increasing the resilience of farmers towards climate change.

On National Farmers' Day, or Kisan Diwas, multi-business conglomerate ITC Limited reaffirmed its commitment to expand its interventions in the field of Climate Smart Agriculture with the goal of assisting Indian farmers in coping with increasing weather-related uncertainties while increasing their incomes.

According to experts, Indian farmers will be deeply impacted by extreme weather events in the days to come. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that with a temperature increase between 1-4 degrees Celsius in India, rice production could decrease by 10-30% and maize by 25-70%. With India set to become the most populated nation in the world by 2023, ensuring food security for the country’s 1.3 billion population will be also critical.

As a company committed to its credo of ‘Nation First, Sab Saath Badhein’, ITC has made sustainable development and climate action core pillars of its corporate strategy. Given the urgent need to build climate resilience in agriculture, ITC has embarked on a mission to make Indian villages climate smart by promoting practices that are 1) weather smart, 2) water smart, 3) seed/breed smart, 4) carbon/nutrient smart and 5) institutional/market smart.

The Company’s flagship ‘Climate Smart Village’ (CSV) initiative in partnership with the Climate Change and Food Security (CCAFS) programme of CGIAR, focuses on lowering agricultural emissions and promoting food security for the nation, whilst augmenting rural incomes. So far, the initiative has covered 2,500 villages across 11 states. CGIAR is a leading global partnership that unites international organizations engaged in research about food security.

Inspired by the Sustainability 2.0 vision articulated by ITC Chairman Sanjiv Puri, the Company is scaling up its interventions in Climate Smart Agriculture, water stewardship – with a special focus on demand side water management, and biodiversity conservation, among others. The aim is to extend its CSV program to over 3 million acres, biodiversity conservation to over 1 million acres and improve crop water use efficiency in agri-value chains to enable annual savings of 2,000 million kiloliters of water by 2030.

S Sivakumar, Group Head of Agri Business & Sustainability, ITC Limited, said, “Agriculture, which provides livelihoods to half of India’s population, is extremely vulnerable to the vagaries of nature and the devastating effects of climate change like frequent and extreme weather events, depleting groundwater, top soil erosion etc. Recognizing these challenges, we have made identification of climate risks and building climate resilience across the value chain key components of our approach to de-risk farming and making it profitable. We are encouraged by the success of the Climate Smart Agriculture initiative and the benefits that it has yielded for farmers and accordingly plan to expand it further.”

ITC’s Climate Smart Village programme has demonstrated encouraging results with GHG emissions of soya and wheat reducing by upto 66%, net returns increasing by upto 99% as well as enhancement in yield by upto 38%. As per a study of 43 villages across 3 states (Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Maharashtra) that were part of the first phase, 70% of the villages have moved into the High Resilience, High Yield category, thus becoming Climate Smart.

Sharing his experience of joining ITC’s sustainable agriculture initiative, Vinod Tyagi, a farmer based out of Sehore, Madhya Pradesh, said: ""With innovative yet simple agriculture equipment and techniques introduced by ITC such as Permanent Broad-Based Furrow and by shifting to a long duration Soybean variety, I have significantly minimized my losses, and I am able to manage the extreme weather impact better. I am witnessing a lower cost of cultivation in tilling, and irrigation & my gains have increased by about 40% just in Soybean crops. I am sure I will benefit by adopting the recommended practices for other crops too.”

Building on its globally acknowledged ITC e-Choupal initiative, the Company has now spearheaded ITCMAARS to bring the benefits of digital revolution to farmers. The aim is to support nearly 4000 FPOs, benefitting 10 million farmers going forward.",https://kj1bcdn.b-cdn.net/media/82842/itc.jpg,[],https://krishijagran.com/industry-news/itc-expands-its-climate-smart-agriculture-initiative-helps-in-99-improvement-of-farmer-returns/

The southern State has already initiated a transformational and holistic shift to sustainable methods of cultivation, livelihood diversification, decentralised renewables and energy efficiency to help farmers survive the climate crisis, he said.

The State is preparing an action plan to help decrease energy-intensive methodologies in land preparation, adding inputs, irrigation and harvesting, the Minister said after inaugurating a two-day consultation on 'Energy Transition in Agriculture Sector of Kerala,' organised jointly by Asar Social Impact Advisors and Energy Management Centre (EMC) under KSEB here.

Prasad said that food processing and value-addition processes would also be brought under renewable energy.

The State had accelerated its massive carbon neutral initiative that would help develop a better farming ecosystem, he detailed.

Warning against the sinister designs of multinational companies and interest groups which use the climate crisis and energy transition to market their equipment which aggravates the energy crisis, Prasad said the State would pay special attention to ensure that the energy transition would turn entirely beneficial to the farmers and the environment.

Kerala would explore renewable energy alternatives to fossil fuel sources to ensure that food systems are built on secure, environmentally sustainable, resilient foundations, Prasad added.

In his keynote address, food policy analyst Devinder Sharma warned all concerned against the Union government's move to use rice meant for food to manufacture ethanol, terming it as an alternative fuel source.

Even while talking about energy transition and climate resilience, India is doing things that would further aggravate the farm and climate crises, he said.

""In Punjab, the State has five lakh tractors, while its actual need was less than one lakh tractors. Such a scenario exists all across India, and they all lead to more and more use of fossil fuels. The governmental push is to reduce the number of farmers from farming and replace them with technology. Such a move will have more and more social and environmental impacts,'' he said.

Dr Ramanhaneyulu, executive director of the Centre for Sustainable Agriculture, pointed out that chemical fertiliser use efficiency has decreased four times in the last 40 years. As a result, the soil demands the application of vast quantities of chemical fertilisers to get the desired yield.

""Soil has become anaemic, and the condition of plants and humans also the same,'' he said.

""A NITI Ayog report confirms that 67 per cent of soils are low carbon. He said that high population, high arable land and high irrigation make agriculture less profitable and unsustainable,'' he said.

He also wanted an integrative approach combining energy, water, climate and land-related challenges to develop resilience.

ASAR chief executive officer Vinutha Gopal said the country's agriculture sector needs transformational changes in the face of an aggressive climate crisis.

The transition must do justice to the farming community, mainly nominal farmers and agricultural workers.

Tamil Nadu planning commission member Sultan Ismail, Solar Energy Corporation general manager Bharat Kumar Reddy and EMC director R Harikumar were among the experts who addressed the consultation on the first day.

“If you look at long-term records, the high temperatures we are witnessing this year have been exacerbated by climate change,"" says Zachariah.
The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) sixth assessment report, 2022, says climate change “is projected to negatively impact the four pillars of food security – availability, access, utilisation and stability.
While the mean temperature is likely to go up over several years, climate change will be experienced as a series of heat spikes and shocks.
The IPCC has warned that climate change will affect the poorer, hotter and low-lying countries disproportionately.","PUNJAB/NEW DELHI : April in north India is a season of approaching bounty – the wheat crop ripens under a spring breeze, and the fields turn many shades of gold. But this year, a sudden spike in temperatures left the crop shrivelled. Wheat was harvested from the fields 15 days ahead of schedule, to save whatever was left from the swirls of hot, steaming air. For several farmers such as Ramandeep Singh, whatever they could salvage was not enough.

A small farmer in Bajak village in Punjab’s Bathinda district, Singh owned four acres of farmland. This year, he had taken a loan of ₹6 lakh to lease 12 acres of land to grow wheat, expecting yields of 20-22 quintals per acre. The extreme heat not only singed the quality of the grain, but also shrunk yields. About 30% of the crop was lost, say the family members of the 35-year-old farmer.

On an unusually hot Baisakhi day, when the village had gathered at a mela to celebrate the harvest festival, Singh left for his fields. He dragged himself back two hours later, hurled himself on the cot and started vomiting. “Main jahreli dawa peeli aa (I have drunk pesticide),"" Ramandeep told the doctors later. His family rushed him first to a government hospital and then to a private hospital, where he died on 18 April. He had left no suicide note, but his family members say he had been depressed over his financial situation.

“The wheat crop was the last straw. Before that, there had been one loss after another. They forced him to take his life,"" says his brother Jagvir. The farmer had defaulted on a ₹4 lakh loan from the Punjab National Bank, and he owed another ₹6 lakh to a middleman. Deputy commissioner of Bathinda, Showkat Ahmed Parry, told the media the reason for Singh’s suicide “does not appear to be a fall in the yield of crop.""

But Singh was not alone. Several farmer suicides were reported that month as wheat yields crashed; estimates by some farmer unions put the figure at 14. For the majority farmers of Punjab, the crucible of the Green Revolution, where wheat and paddy account for 85% of area under cultivation, and where agricultural incomes have been on a decline, this summer was just another example of the rising risks of the farming life.

The tipping point

Wheat is a rabi crop, generally sown between October and December. It is highly heat-sensitive; the two months of February-March are crucial for the grain’s development, when wheat kernels plump up with starch and protein. “Temperature over 34 degrees can lead to shortfalls in yields, depending on the intensity, area and duration of exposure,"" explains Mariam Zachariah, a climate scientist and research associate at the Imperial College London, who studied the impact of heat stress on the productivity of wheat in the states of Indo-Gangetic Plains.

During March this year, northwest and central India experienced two back-to-back early heat waves —the first from 11- 19 March, followed by another from 27-31 March. Average temperatures in north India in March-April went up by 4.5 - 6.4 degrees Celsius, often crossing 37 degrees. The Government of India, in a notification, announced March 2022 as the hottest since 1901, the year the colonial government started maintaining temperature records.

Research carried out by scientists from India, UK, Norway and China and published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Research last year found that heat stress events are increasing in India’s wheat belt, which can lead to losses in yield ranging from 1% to 8%; absence of irrigation facilities is likely to increase that figure manifold, leading to losses between 4% and 36%. “If you look at long-term records, the high temperatures we are witnessing this year have been exacerbated by climate change,"" says Zachariah.

For years now, climate scientists have been warning that extreme weather events can have consequences for the world’s food security, and social and economic development. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) sixth assessment report, 2022, says climate change “is projected to negatively impact the four pillars of food security – availability, access, utilisation and stability. Low-income producers and consumers are likely to be most affected because of a lack of resources to invest in adaptation and diversification measures."" Regions in Africa, Asia and South America are likely to be particularly vulnerable. While agricultural production may increase in colder, high-altitude regions, the crop yields are likely to decrease in tropical and subtropical regions, the report warned.

We are already seeing some of that playing out. The repercussions of this year’s March heat wave, for example, rippled out from the fields of Punjab to the international market. The war in Ukraine triggered a global wheat shortage.

India, the second-largest wheat producer of the world, stepped up to make up for the supply disruptions from Russia, promising “to feed the world"". As prices of the grain soared across the world, India exported a record 1.4 million tonnes of wheat this April (compared to the 2.4 lakh tonnes in April 2021) – and was set to sell more.

But the heat-shrunk crop forced a swift change in plans. In Punjab, surveys carried out by the state’s agricultural department, reported by several newspapers, suggested that the heat wave shaved off yields by at least 5 quintals per acre. Eventually, the central government had to revise the estimate of wheat production from 111.32 million tonnes to 105 mt – a fall from last year. Jitters about domestic food inflation and food security finally led India to abruptly ban all wheat exports on 14 May. While India’s decision was not received well by the world, according to Sukhpal Singh, economist at Punjab Agricultural University, “exporting a sizable amount of wheat may have reduced the supply of foodgrains in the country, increasing poverty in an already struggling economy"".

For the government, the hard choices between farmer profits and food security will continue to come up. A recent report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on climate change and food systems predicts a 16% drop in India’s food production, and warns that the number of those at risk for hunger could increase 23% by 2030 due to climate change.

For small farmers like Ramandeep Singh, the tumult in global wheat markets had little effect on their fortunes. “Most of the farmers sold all the wheat only at the MSP of ₹2,015 per quintal,"" says Harinder Singh, a wheat farmer, who is also a representative of Bharatiya Kisan Union in Bathinda. Only those who had godowns to store the grain, and wait for the prices to rise higher, would have benefitted, he said. But wheat yields have fallen across the board, and even large farmers have seen their calculations go awry.

A trail of damage

In Punjab, conversations with farmers reveal a trail of damage from the changes in weather. This is hardly surprising. Climate change will potentially leave no aspect of agriculture untouched – from changes in soil and water to the behaviour of pests, from the health and productivity of livestock to the fall in the nutritional value of food.

For example, a farmer from Barnala district, Jailawar Singh, rued that the potato crop this year had shrunk in weight and quality. Another farmer reported that the milk yields of cattle had reduced by 1-2 litres, as had the yield of cattle feed he grows on his 2-acre farm. According to farmer Gurcharan Singh, who grows moong (green gram lentil) on the borders of Bathinda and Barnala, the pesticides he used were ineffectual this year, leading to a severe damage to this crop. “Heat not only impacts the pests’ behaviour but also the efficacy of chemicals used to treat the disease in the crops,"" says Mukesh Kumar Dhillon, principal scientist, entomology, at Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi. As plants and pests modify their physicochemical properties to fight extreme weather events, the ideal condition for the chemicals to work no longer exists. That is to say, the pesticides become less and less effective.

In many ways, Ramandeep Singh’s story is one of several small climate-related shocks adding up to a disaster. Last year, the Bathinda farmer had taken six acres on lease to grow cotton. But his harvest had been ruined by an attack of pink bollworm—an expert committee set up by the Punjab government found that the infection was a result of a new pest strain and exceptionally high rainfall and had destroyed 70% of the crop across Bathinda.

“All crops are sensitive to heat waves, especially vegetables. But since wheat is one of the most grown crops, its impacts are far-reaching and widely talked about,"" says Pavneet Kaur Kingra, head, department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, at Punjab Agriculture University.

In Punjab, as agricultural incomes fall and indebtedness rises, the lack of a safety net will only multiply risks from climate vagaries, and make more farmers vulnerable. For instance, the state’s farmers are not covered by crop insurance. Punjab and some other states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Telangana and West Bengal, have exited the Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) launched in 2016, which would have secured oilseed and food crops from both natural and unnatural disasters. But several farmers fault the scheme on several counts— high premiums; untimely, insufficient and delayed compensation and a faulty technique to assess crop loss. Under the scheme, a farmer is compensated on the basis of the average of crop loss in a notified area. “If a pest, a hailstorm or an animal damages my crop, shouldn’t I get the compensation, irrespective of what happened on my neighbour’s farm ?"" asks Harinder.

“In the digital world when we can identify and map remote places using technology, why do crop insurance companies still estimate loss by working on the average production of village panchayats ?"" says Devinder Sharma, a food policy expert based in Punjab. He recommends that the state compensate farmers for losses, and encourage crop diversity by introducing more assured public buy-back schemes.

How to weather the future

Climate change is not going to be a smooth transition, It’s going to be a bumpy ride,"" warns K S Kavi Kumar, professor at Madras School of Economics. While the mean temperature is likely to go up over several years, climate change will be experienced as a series of heat spikes and shocks. “And we are absolutely unprepared for these short-term transitions,"" says Kumar.

The IPCC has warned that climate change will affect the poorer, hotter and low-lying countries disproportionately. But the resources to weather the crisis must come from the developed world, argues Harjeet Singh, senior advisor, Climate Action Network International. “There is a narrowing window of opportunity for climate resilient development, which means that adaptation has to be skilled up across the world, this is where developing countries need to be supported. This heat wave highlighted the fact that even large developing countries like India are not prepared and globally we have not done enough to provide money, technology or capacity building in time,"" he says. Government policies must quickly respond to extremes in weather and invest in early warning systems, say experts.

“We might have to re-plan and reassess the global crop pattern to suit the changing temperatures,"" says Singh, the economist from PAU. He explains this might also mean a shift in the types of crops grown, cropping patterns and duration and, most importantly, investing in research to find stress-tolerant crop varieties that can cope with extreme temperatures.

For Ramandeep Singh’s family, the choices are stark. Saddled with debts, the responsibility of educating his brother’s children, Jagvir has even thought of selling the land. He will not be alone. “Almost everyone in the village I know is losing their farm lands,"" says Harinder. The spiral of unprofitable farm income, increased dependency on loans and climate insecurity might make it even harder for Punjab’s farmers to stay on in their fields.",https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/05/23/600x338/LSpic_1653325345815_1653325355566.jpg,[],https://www.livemint.com/industry/agriculture/heat-hardship-and-punjab-s-bitter-harvest-11653325173132.html

He also wanted an integrative approach combining energy, water, climate and land-related challenges to develop resilience.

ASAR chief executive officer Vinutha Gopal said the country's agriculture sector needs transformational changes in the face of an aggressive climate crisis.

The transition must do justice to the farming community, mainly nominal farmers and agricultural workers.

The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) sixth assessment report, 2022, says climate change “is projected to negatively impact the four pillars of food security – availability, access, utilisation and stability.
While the mean temperature is likely to go up over several years, climate change will be experienced as a series of heat spikes and shocks.
The IPCC has warned that climate change will affect the poorer, hotter and low-lying countries disproportionately.","PUNJAB/NEW DELHI : April in north India is a season of approaching bounty – the wheat crop ripens under a spring breeze, and the fields turn many shades of gold. But this year, a sudden spike in temperatures left the crop shrivelled. Wheat was harvested from the fields 15 days ahead of schedule, to save whatever was left from the swirls of hot, steaming air. For several farmers such as Ramandeep Singh, whatever they could salvage was not enough.

A small farmer in Bajak village in Punjab’s Bathinda district, Singh owned four acres of farmland. This year, he had taken a loan of ₹6 lakh to lease 12 acres of land to grow wheat, expecting yields of 20-22 quintals per acre. The extreme heat not only singed the quality of the grain, but also shrunk yields. About 30% of the crop was lost, say the family members of the 35-year-old farmer.

On an unusually hot Baisakhi day, when the village had gathered at a mela to celebrate the harvest festival, Singh left for his fields. He dragged himself back two hours later, hurled himself on the cot and started vomiting. “Main jahreli dawa peeli aa (I have drunk pesticide),"" Ramandeep told the doctors later. His family rushed him first to a government hospital and then to a private hospital, where he died on 18 April. He had left no suicide note, but his family members say he had been depressed over his financial situation.

“The wheat crop was the last straw. Before that, there had been one loss after another. They forced him to take his life,"" says his brother Jagvir. The farmer had defaulted on a ₹4 lakh loan from the Punjab National Bank, and he owed another ₹6 lakh to a middleman. Deputy commissioner of Bathinda, Showkat Ahmed Parry, told the media the reason for Singh’s suicide “does not appear to be a fall in the yield of crop.""

But Singh was not alone. Several farmer suicides were reported that month as wheat yields crashed; estimates by some farmer unions put the figure at 14. For the majority farmers of Punjab, the crucible of the Green Revolution, where wheat and paddy account for 85% of area under cultivation, and where agricultural incomes have been on a decline, this summer was just another example of the rising risks of the farming life.

The tipping point

Wheat is a rabi crop, generally sown between October and December. It is highly heat-sensitive; the two months of February-March are crucial for the grain’s development, when wheat kernels plump up with starch and protein. “Temperature over 34 degrees can lead to shortfalls in yields, depending on the intensity, area and duration of exposure,"" explains Mariam Zachariah, a climate scientist and research associate at the Imperial College London, who studied the impact of heat stress on the productivity of wheat in the states of Indo-Gangetic Plains.

During March this year, northwest and central India experienced two back-to-back early heat waves —the first from 11- 19 March, followed by another from 27-31 March. Average temperatures in north India in March-April went up by 4.5 - 6.4 degrees Celsius, often crossing 37 degrees. The Government of India, in a notification, announced March 2022 as the hottest since 1901, the year the colonial government started maintaining temperature records.

Research carried out by scientists from India, UK, Norway and China and published in the Journal of Agriculture and Food Research last year found that heat stress events are increasing in India’s wheat belt, which can lead to losses in yield ranging from 1% to 8%; absence of irrigation facilities is likely to increase that figure manifold, leading to losses between 4% and 36%. “If you look at long-term records, the high temperatures we are witnessing this year have been exacerbated by climate change,"" says Zachariah.

For years now, climate scientists have been warning that extreme weather events can have consequences for the world’s food security, and social and economic development. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) sixth assessment report, 2022, says climate change “is projected to negatively impact the four pillars of food security – availability, access, utilisation and stability. Low-income producers and consumers are likely to be most affected because of a lack of resources to invest in adaptation and diversification measures."" Regions in Africa, Asia and South America are likely to be particularly vulnerable. While agricultural production may increase in colder, high-altitude regions, the crop yields are likely to decrease in tropical and subtropical regions, the report warned.

We are already seeing some of that playing out. The repercussions of this year’s March heat wave, for example, rippled out from the fields of Punjab to the international market. The war in Ukraine triggered a global wheat shortage.

India, the second-largest wheat producer of the world, stepped up to make up for the supply disruptions from Russia, promising “to feed the world"". As prices of the grain soared across the world, India exported a record 1.4 million tonnes of wheat this April (compared to the 2.4 lakh tonnes in April 2021) – and was set to sell more.

But the heat-shrunk crop forced a swift change in plans. In Punjab, surveys carried out by the state’s agricultural department, reported by several newspapers, suggested that the heat wave shaved off yields by at least 5 quintals per acre. Eventually, the central government had to revise the estimate of wheat production from 111.32 million tonnes to 105 mt – a fall from last year. Jitters about domestic food inflation and food security finally led India to abruptly ban all wheat exports on 14 May. While India’s decision was not received well by the world, according to Sukhpal Singh, economist at Punjab Agricultural University, “exporting a sizable amount of wheat may have reduced the supply of foodgrains in the country, increasing poverty in an already struggling economy"".

For the government, the hard choices between farmer profits and food security will continue to come up. A recent report by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) on climate change and food systems predicts a 16% drop in India’s food production, and warns that the number of those at risk for hunger could increase 23% by 2030 due to climate change.

For small farmers like Ramandeep Singh, the tumult in global wheat markets had little effect on their fortunes. “Most of the farmers sold all the wheat only at the MSP of ₹2,015 per quintal,"" says Harinder Singh, a wheat farmer, who is also a representative of Bharatiya Kisan Union in Bathinda. Only those who had godowns to store the grain, and wait for the prices to rise higher, would have benefitted, he said. But wheat yields have fallen across the board, and even large farmers have seen their calculations go awry.

A trail of damage

In Punjab, conversations with farmers reveal a trail of damage from the changes in weather. This is hardly surprising. Climate change will potentially leave no aspect of agriculture untouched – from changes in soil and water to the behaviour of pests, from the health and productivity of livestock to the fall in the nutritional value of food.

For example, a farmer from Barnala district, Jailawar Singh, rued that the potato crop this year had shrunk in weight and quality. Another farmer reported that the milk yields of cattle had reduced by 1-2 litres, as had the yield of cattle feed he grows on his 2-acre farm. According to farmer Gurcharan Singh, who grows moong (green gram lentil) on the borders of Bathinda and Barnala, the pesticides he used were ineffectual this year, leading to a severe damage to this crop. “Heat not only impacts the pests’ behaviour but also the efficacy of chemicals used to treat the disease in the crops,"" says Mukesh Kumar Dhillon, principal scientist, entomology, at Indian Council of Agricultural Research, New Delhi. As plants and pests modify their physicochemical properties to fight extreme weather events, the ideal condition for the chemicals to work no longer exists. That is to say, the pesticides become less and less effective.

In many ways, Ramandeep Singh’s story is one of several small climate-related shocks adding up to a disaster. Last year, the Bathinda farmer had taken six acres on lease to grow cotton. But his harvest had been ruined by an attack of pink bollworm—an expert committee set up by the Punjab government found that the infection was a result of a new pest strain and exceptionally high rainfall and had destroyed 70% of the crop across Bathinda.

“All crops are sensitive to heat waves, especially vegetables. But since wheat is one of the most grown crops, its impacts are far-reaching and widely talked about,"" says Pavneet Kaur Kingra, head, department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, at Punjab Agriculture University.

In Punjab, as agricultural incomes fall and indebtedness rises, the lack of a safety net will only multiply risks from climate vagaries, and make more farmers vulnerable. For instance, the state’s farmers are not covered by crop insurance. Punjab and some other states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Gujarat, Telangana and West Bengal, have exited the Prime Minister Fasal Bima Yojana (PMFBY) launched in 2016, which would have secured oilseed and food crops from both natural and unnatural disasters. But several farmers fault the scheme on several counts— high premiums; untimely, insufficient and delayed compensation and a faulty technique to assess crop loss. Under the scheme, a farmer is compensated on the basis of the average of crop loss in a notified area. “If a pest, a hailstorm or an animal damages my crop, shouldn’t I get the compensation, irrespective of what happened on my neighbour’s farm ?"" asks Harinder.

“In the digital world when we can identify and map remote places using technology, why do crop insurance companies still estimate loss by working on the average production of village panchayats ?"" says Devinder Sharma, a food policy expert based in Punjab. He recommends that the state compensate farmers for losses, and encourage crop diversity by introducing more assured public buy-back schemes.

How to weather the future

Climate change is not going to be a smooth transition, It’s going to be a bumpy ride,"" warns K S Kavi Kumar, professor at Madras School of Economics. While the mean temperature is likely to go up over several years, climate change will be experienced as a series of heat spikes and shocks. “And we are absolutely unprepared for these short-term transitions,"" says Kumar.

The IPCC has warned that climate change will affect the poorer, hotter and low-lying countries disproportionately. But the resources to weather the crisis must come from the developed world, argues Harjeet Singh, senior advisor, Climate Action Network International. “There is a narrowing window of opportunity for climate resilient development, which means that adaptation has to be skilled up across the world, this is where developing countries need to be supported. This heat wave highlighted the fact that even large developing countries like India are not prepared and globally we have not done enough to provide money, technology or capacity building in time,"" he says. Government policies must quickly respond to extremes in weather and invest in early warning systems, say experts.

“We might have to re-plan and reassess the global crop pattern to suit the changing temperatures,"" says Singh, the economist from PAU. He explains this might also mean a shift in the types of crops grown, cropping patterns and duration and, most importantly, investing in research to find stress-tolerant crop varieties that can cope with extreme temperatures.

For Ramandeep Singh’s family, the choices are stark. Saddled with debts, the responsibility of educating his brother’s children, Jagvir has even thought of selling the land. He will not be alone. “Almost everyone in the village I know is losing their farm lands,"" says Harinder. The spiral of unprofitable farm income, increased dependency on loans and climate insecurity might make it even harder for Punjab’s farmers to stay on in their fields.",https://images.livemint.com/img/2022/05/23/600x338/LSpic_1653325345815_1653325355566.jpg,[],https://www.livemint.com/industry/agriculture/heat-hardship-and-punjab-s-bitter-harvest-11653325173132.html

Siddipet: Health Minister T Harish Rao called upon the women of Siddipet district to visit government hospitals for deliveries rather than going to private hospitals which would charge them exorbitantly.

The Minister was speaking after distributing three-wheeler TVS mopeds to 20 physically challenged persons in Siddipet, CMRF cheques worth Rs 17.16 lakh to 47 beneficiaries, and Kalyana Lakshmi cheques worth Rs 1.34 crore to 134 women here on Tuesday.

The Minister said he got to know some women were planning their deliveries on the best days and going for C-Section surgeries in private hospitals. Cautioning against such practices, Rao said the mother and child may face serious health issues for a longer time because of this. The Minister underlined the importance of doing yoga and exercises advised by the doctor for a normal and healthy delivery.

Saying that they were giving KCR Kits to all new mothers, Rao said the government would start giving nutrition kits to pregnant women from April onwards.

Stating that Siddipet Constituency had benefited the most from CMRF, the Minister said as many as 6,463 beneficiaries were given Rs 26.05 crore. Physically challenged persons were also given Vikalangula Corporation loans during the meeting.

On April 11th, the Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS)-led government brought their protest against the Centre’s ‘discriminatory’ paddy procurement policy to New Delhi.

The Telangana government is asking the Centre to buy more than 90 per cent of its stock of parboiled rice at Minimum Support Price, some of which is also from the last Rabi season. Over six million farmers are likely to get affected if this doesn’t happen.

But what is parboiled rice and why is it important? Parboiled rice, as the name suggests, is rice that has been partially boiled or cooked. It includes a hydrothermal processing of rice paddy before milling.

Processes include:

Soaking paddy in lukewarm water

Steaming

Drying

Husking

Milling

At the end of the process, you get whole grains which are separated and resistant to breakage. Parboiling rice is an economical way to not only improve storage capacity (since it is resistant to weevils) of the grain but also increase nutritional value.



It contains greater amounts of B-vitamins, calcium, potassium, iron and free amino acids as compared to raw rice. This variety of rice is widely consumed in south and southeast Asia, especially in countries like Thailand, Vietnam, Taiwan, Indonesia and India, where the southern states produce and consume more of it.

Even though Telangana does not consume parboiled rice extensively, they produce large quantities during the Rabi Season for states that are deficit in production. But in the last few years, production in states like Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Jharkhand has increased, resulting in less movement in these states.

But the Centre claims that since the demand is low, it would be a waste to buy excess quantities. The current stock is enough to meet demand for two years. The Central government has made it clear that it intends to procure mostly raw rice from Telangana according to national demands.

The chief minister claims that the central government had asked farmers to shift from paddy in the Rabi season and promised to procure the entire quantity.

In 2020-21, the Food Corporation of India (FCI) procured 25.62 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) of parboiled rice from Telangana, although the quantity was higher in 2019-20 at 44.71 LMT. The standard procedure of procurement is that the FCI has an agreement with every state.

But Telangana is a decentralised procurement state where the state procures and mills rice for the public distribution system. It keeps the quantities required and transfers the excess to FCI. But the FCI has an option of specifying how procurement will take place under the decentralised model to meet the needs of the entire country.",https://i.ytimg.com/vi/w-J07iXv32E/hqdefault.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/video/agriculture/why-is-telangana-asking-the-centre-to-procure-its-excess-stock-of-parboiled-rice--82472

Acreage for paddy and pulses is lagging far behind last year’s levels even as the 2022 Kharif sowing period is drawing to a close. Paddy plantation is over 2 million hectares less than last year's.

Jharkhand has been affected the most. Paddy plantation has been done in less than half of the target area and most farmers have given up on being able to transplant it this season.

Paddy was planted in 1.75 million ha through the first week of September last year in Jharkhand. This year, 0.77 million ha were sown by September 2, 2022 — a deficit of 55 per cent.

The state government had set a target of sowing paddy on 1.8 million ha this year. The average sowing area is 1.54 million ha, considering the sowing in the last five years. However, paddy was sown on 1.72 million ha in 2020-21.

Madhya Pradesh has also seen a significant deficit. The sowing area for paddy has decreased by 0.63 million ha through September 2, 2022, compared with last year.

In 2021, 3.85 million ha of paddy were sown on MP, which has decreased to 3.22 million ha. Oilseed-sowing has decreased by 0.3 million ha too. However, the sowing of pulses has seen an increase.

More pulses were planted in 0.4 million ha in MP this year compared with last year. This is unlike Jharkhand, where sowing of pulses is also hit by 0.13 million ha less than last year.

In general, pulses are sown on 0.43 million ha in Jharkhand. Last year, this was completed by the first week of September, but this year only 0.29 million ha of pulses have been sown, which is around 70 per cent of the area.

After Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal has seen a huge deficit in paddy plantation, by 0.44 million ha. Paddy sowing in Chhattisgarh has gone down by 0.39 million ha, 2.61 lakh ha in Uttar Pradesh and 2.18 lakh ha in Bihar.

On the other hand, a few states report an increase in paddy sowing. Telangana has seen a rise in paddy plantations by 0.47 million ha. Haryana has seen an increase of 94,000 ha, 78,000 ha in Nagaland and 55,000 ha in Gujarat.

Area of ​​pulses also decreased

The sowing of pulses is not much better, either. The general area under cultivation of pulses is 14 million ha. Through the first week of September, 13.54 million ha of pulses had been sown last year, which is 12.95 million ha this time.

The sowing of kulthi beans (horse gram) has been quite low this time. Around 200,000 ha of kulthi is sown on average. This year only 23,000 ha have been sown as compared to 48,000 ha last year.

However, sowing of coarse cereals and cotton in the current Kharif season has increased this year, with millets seeing the most rise of around 10 per cent.

In the first week of September last year, 6.32 million ha of millets were sown, but this year it has increased to 7.04 million ha. However, the five-year average for millets is 7.34 million ha.

Maize has also reported an increase in sowing compared with last year. The area under maize last year was 8.03 million ha, which has reached 8.15 million ha this year. The average of maize is 7.46 million ha.

The total sown area of ​​oilseeds crops last year was 18.96 million ha by the first week of September. This time, 18.85 million ha have been sown. Peanut crops have seen the biggest impact. Last year groundnut was sown on 4.86 million ha, but it is only 4.51 million ha this time.

Soyabean has emerged as a significant Kharif crop and its sowing this time is almost equal to last year in the country, 12.03 million ha.

The crop is grown mostly in MP; however, the erratic monsoon had farmers confused about it this year. Through September 2, 2022, farmers in MP had sown 5.01 million ha of soyabean, compared with 5.51 million ha in the same period. A total of 5.84 million ha of soybean was sown on 2021.

Unprecedented changes in agriculture sector

Chief guest at the event, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar expressed happiness over Outlook’s participation in the summit and also encouraged and awarded all the winners on the occasion.

Addressing the farmers, citizens and enlightened people associated with the agriculture sector, the Union minister said that India was in the top two places in the global scenario in the field of agricultural products.

To maintain its position in the top league, he said, the Centre has to protect farmers from the damage caused by natural calamity by using private investment and technology. In order to support the farmers, the government of India’s budget for the agricultural sector has jumped from Rs 22,000 to Rs 1,32,000 crore over the past eight years.

The Union Agriculture Minister further said that the government had decided to set up 10,000 FPOs by allocating a budget of Rs.6800 crore. Besides, it has launched ‘Oil Palm Mission’ for smooth supply of edible oil. Under this mission, steps are being taken to promote oilseed cultivation in six lakh hectares of land by earmarking Rs 11,000 crore.

Tomar also stressed the need for simplifying the process of credit to support the farmers. At present, under the Digital Agriculture Mission, the Government of India is working on a plan to connect the farmers of the country with banks and provide them easy loans.

The Union Minister urged all the agricultural education institutions, scientists and Kisan Vikas Kendras to make a united effort to reduce the losses in the agriculture sector and increase the productivity of the farm sector.

Concern over growing population and climate change

Earlier, during a panel discussion in the first session of the summit, policy-makers, experts from the technological and agriculture sectors and officials of farm implements manufacturing companies deliberated at length on ‘Increasing population, climate change and building food system through innovations and technology in India’.

Rajiv Rellan, head of sales and marketing of Swaraj Division, said that about 40 per cent of India’s population depends on agriculture and they still wait for the monsoon to do farming. This affects the agriculture sector adversely. Rellan said that efforts are being made by the Swaraj group towards technological development to deal with the situation.

Former president of National Academy of Agricultural Sciences and Padma Bhushan awardee R.D. Singh said, “Food prices have increased substantially today. According to UN estimates, India will become number one in the world in terms of population next year. “By 2030, its population will rise to 250 crore. In such a situation, many challenges will come to the fore, so more emphasis will have to be laid on its solution through technology and research,” he said.

Shri Ram Kaundinya, Managing Director, Advanta India Limited also discussed the growing population and the impacts of climate change on agriculture. Talking about the challenges ahead, he said, “Climate change is not something that will happen in the future. It is already here. In the next 50 years, we are going to eat twice the amount of food we have eaten in the last 10 thousand years. In such a situation, the question arises as to where will the food come from?”

He suggested that changes in agriculture in conformity with climate change, could check the problems related to agriculture and food supply.

Sundeep Kumar Nayak, Director General, National Productivity Council of India, said that if the impact of climate change in the agriculture sector is to be mitigated, then we have to work through our two pillars i. e. youth and women. He said that about 94 per cent of the farmers in the country are members of some cooperative organisation. In such a situation, taking steps through cooperatives would be effective.

Employment generation through technological development

In the second panel at the Outlook Agritech Summit and Swaraj Awards, the discussion revolved around employment generation through innovation and technology, as also to make agriculture essential again for income growth.

Dr. Ashok Dalwai, agriculture expert and CEO of National Rainfed Area Authority, said that in order to give a fillip to the agriculture sector in India, it is necessary that alongside agriculture, animal husbandry, dairy, floriculture, bee keeping, fisheries, etc should be kept in sharp focus. Also, there is a need to add new dimensions in the marketing and processing sectors through technological development in the agriculture sector.

Agriculture scientist Dr Suresh Paul said that agriculture is being re-established as a priority in the country. “It will benefit everyone, from farmers to consumers. At a time when the country’s growth rate has decreased, the agricultural growth rate is increasing continuously,” he said. “It will help the poor and homeless people of the country get food security and alleviate poverty alleviation. He said that by connecting agriculture with modernity, steps are being done to curb the expenditure involved in it. Drone technology and artificial intelligence is also being used now.”

Another agricultural scientist Dr. Satendra Kumar Singh said that the nature of agriculture is like beekeeping. If the environment is not good, the agriculture sector will not progress and the farmer will be forced to migrate. “Therefore, we have to ensure that the farmer should have all the things he needs like fertilizers, seeds etc. in proper quality, at the right time and at the right price. Only then will the next generation of farmers do farming,” he added.

Dr. D N Thakur, National President of Sahakar Bharati and an expert on agriculture, said that there is a need to change the system for developing the agriculture sector. “We have to have discussions, so that the social system can easily assimilate the changes,” he said.

“If we want to improve the condition of the farmer, we have to provide all the necessary facilities to them by setting up Kisan Vikas Kendras in the rural areas. Only then the agriculture sector will prosper.”.

Spirit of cooperation among countries must for growth in the agriculture sector.

On this occasion, Michiel van Erkel, Agriculture Counsellor from the Netherlands Embassy said that he never went to the fields, nor did he know much about agriculture, until there was a need for a job.

But when he looked at the things related to agriculture, he found that this is a sector which is full of possibilities. Giving the example of a Dutch company, he said that today efforts are being made to upgrade agriculture with the help of technology. Michiel, speaking about agriculture and agricultural products, said that the Netherlands is the largest exporter of agricultural products after the US.

“Now the time has come to find solutions to the problems of farmers with smart technology. Farmers from almost everywhere in the world are struggling with the problem of water, and climate change. Currently, the Netherlands Embassy and the Government of India are working together on greenhouse technology for the progress of agriculture,” he said, adding that India was a powerhouse of knowledge and the Dutch government was investing heavily for the sake of farmers’ benefit.

Chhattisgarh - a model of agricultural development

The Chhattisgarh State Government has played a key role in organising the ‘Outlook Agritech Summit and Swaraj Awards 2022’. Giving his best wishes for the successful organisation of Outlook Agriculture Summit and Swaraj awards through a video recorded message, Chhattisgarh Chief Minister Shri Bhupesh Baghel said that Outlook deserves congratulations for organising such an event.

“Today, providing food grains to the growing population is the biggest challenge of the agriculture sector. Besides, increasing cost in the agriculture sector and uncontrolled use of chemical fertilizers is a matter of great concern. There is a dire need to deal with them, otherwise slowly the farmer will go on to migrate from farming to something else.”

Chief Minister Baghel said that the Chhattisgarh government was working towards fisheries sustainable agricultural development. Support price of crops like paddy, maize, millets is being raised while 65 types of small agricultural produce are being procured by the government. “Due to such policies, reverse migration is taking place in Chhattisgarh. This is a pleasant initiative,” he said.

Chhattisgarh and Himachal Pradesh governments were the state partners of the event.

Speaking on the occasion, Anuja Kadian, Government and Industry Affairs Leader, APAC Corteva Agrisciences, our associate partner for this event, said that the farmer faces the first impact of climate change. To deal with this, private investment in agriculture is necessary. Only then can technological development and research be possible. Also, along with technological development, we have to ensure that the youth take to farming, he said.

Agriculture has been affected worldwide due to weather imbalance. Taking up farming, protecting land and water resources and providing food products to citizens at reasonable prices have emerged as a major challenge. today All these challenges can be solved only through ideological discussion and technological development.

Corteva has planned an unprecedented transformation in the field of agriculture by the year 2025. Its effort is to strengthen the agriculture sector with technological development keeping in mind the climate change. Events have been organised by Corteva on climate change in which representatives of 12 countries participated.

The objective of such programmes organised by Corteva is to ensure sustainable development in agriculture through exchange of knowledge, information and research.

Harish Chavan, CEO of Swaraj Division (Mahindra & Mahindra) also presented his views at ‘Outlook AgritechSummit and Swaraj Awards 2022’. He said such events play an important role for development in the agriculture sector.

It is through them that dialogue is established between the government, farmers, and agricultural experts. Besides, it is quite an occasion to honour the farmers and experts and scientists working tirelessly in the field of agriculture. It is also important to see that the agricultural growth rate has been leading even in the times of Covid.

The Telangana government’s recently constituted coordination committees to settle forest land conflicts have come under the scanner. These committees parallel statutory committees provided under the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006 (FRA).

The Telangana high court is to decide on the issue. The state government, vide an order dated September 11, 2022, undermined the role of Gram Sabhas and other statutory committees formed under the FRA.

The committees are constituted by officials of different departments, members of parliament and legislative assemblies.

FRA empowers Gram Sabhas and committees headed by the sub-collectors and the district collectors to determine and recognise the forest rights of the claimants.

The committees must be constituted by the officials of tribal development department, the elected representatives of panchayath raj institutions and the officials from the revenue and forest departments.

These statutory committees are empowered to determine and recognise the forest rights ensured under the Act. Gram Sabhas has a specific role in managing and conserving the forests. The newly constituted coordination committees undermine this role.

The Telangana government is delaying the implementation of FRA, which aims to undo historical injustice done to tribals and other traditional forest dwellers.

The Telangana government has stated until recently that the forest land claims would be resolved if the Centre extends the cut-off date stipulated in the FRA. The Act provided December 13, 2005, as the cut-off date to identify eligible forest land claimants.

Around 5,087 claims of non-tribals were rejected as they could not provide the required evidence to support their forest land occupancy for three generations or 75 years. The proposed legislation would help them to claim their rights, according to sources.

FRA does not, however, mandate occupancy of forest land for 75 years. Only their residence in the area and dependence on forest count towards the 75-year criteria. They need not prove their occupancy before the cut-off date.

The Telangana government had written a letter to the Centre, seeking an extension in the cut-off date to make more tribals eligible. It has also requested amendments to the FRA by relaxing conditions for non-tribals.

The minister for tribal affairs rejected the amendment proposed by the state government in March 2022. The minister observed that it might lead to claims from the non-tribals who came to forests much later.

It will be detrimental to the interests of tribals and the states are required to prevent tribal land alienation in the Schedule V areas, he added.

The government has recognised individual forest land rights for the 97,434 tribal families over 0.310 million acres as of July 2022. Over 0.2 million tribal land claims are pending before Gram Sabhas.

Telangana’s tribal welfare minister further requested the Government of India in July 2022 to extend the cut-off date to resolve the Podu land claims of tribals in the state to enhance their livelihoods. Podu means cultivation of forest land on hill slopes. It is also known as slash and burn cultivation

If the cut-off date is relaxed, it will benefit nearly 33,503 tribal families to secure forest land titles over 0.120 million acres in Telangana.

Suppose the Telangana Government is committed to ensuring forest land titles to the tribals. In that case, it can secure the notification from the Governor under para 5 (1) of the Fifth Schedule of the Constitution and extend the cut-off date.

The Governor is empowered to modify the provisions of the State or Central legislations under the Fifth Schedule to the Constitution and apply the same to the Schedule Areas to protect the interest of tribals.

However, the state government is looking for solutions from the Centre or by constituting committees without exploring the possibilities in existing laws and constitutional provisions.

Hyderabad: With copious rains this year, the Hara Bahara project in Telangana aims to drop about one crore seed balls in the forest area using drones this year. The effort is to cover 12,000 hectare across the State. The States’ IT and Forest Departments are driving this initiative.

The ‘Hara Bahara’ project was announced formally last year but pilots have been taken up earlier. The project has been hailed as pathbreaking for using drone technology to rejuvenate the degraded lands inside the forests.

City-based Marut Drones is the technology partner for the exercise. ‘Seedcopter’, an aerial seeding solution for rapid and scalable reforestation developed by it, will be used for dispersing the seed balls. The afforestation exercise using drones will begin next week and go on for about two months.

V Prem Kumar, Founder of Marut Drones, said the copious rains this year are likely to improve the survival rate of the saplings. Several agriculture valuechain have become partners in the project to supply the seed balls, which will be targeted into barren and empty forest lands. “About one crore seed balls will be dispersed using drones,” he said.

A field survey identifies the areas that need urgent attention. This data is used to determine the number and species of trees that can be planted there based on the soil, climate, indigenous seed varieties and historical growth data using AI. The path followed by the drones are geotagged, facilitating periodic drone monitoring of sown area to collect tree statistics.

The Hara Bahara project will accelerate State’s Haritha Haram programme, which aims to increase the green cover to 33 per cent in Telangana. The State initiatives are yielding green results and it has been ranked second in the country in terms of increase in forest cover by 632 square km, as per the India State of Forest Report 2021 prepared by the Forest Survey of India (FSI).

Social enterprise

Several partners are engaged in making the seed balls. They in turn employ people from nearby villages for making these seed balls, thus creating employment to the locals. The focus is on using fruit bearing and shade giving seeds.

“We have identified ten deforested areas in Telangana by the support of the Telangana Forest Department and are ready to disperse seed balls in these areas using drones,” said Gubba Kirana, CEO of Gubba Cold Storage, one of the participant companies in the drone-based afforestation drive. It is partnering with agri inputs player Syngenta to provide about one lakh seed balls to the afforestation drive under its `Our Seed Our Planet initiative’. The survival rates in the previous year has been between 22 to 45 per cent. The focus is on local species of trees, he said.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Drone.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/copious-rains-set-stage-for-drone-based-afforestation-drive-in-telangana

Hemendra Mathur, Chairman, FICCI Task Force on Agri Start-ups, highlighted that startups can build innovative solutions around traceability, quality assaying and trade facilitation to boost India’s food and agri exports. On the adverse impacts of climate change as well as financing challenges in the agriculture sector, he said, “Agritech, climate-tech and fintech have to merge with each other to handle these challenges.”

Vedika Kapoor, Head GA, South Asia, Corteva, speaking at FICCI’s Agri Startup event said, sustainable innovation, soil health management and providing climate-resilient technologies to farmers are vital. Sustainability is no more an option but a necessity, it has to be a collective responsibility of all.

US Soy embraces sustainable agricultural practices to meet today’s global need for soy products without compromising the ability for future needs to be met said, Jaison John, Team Lead -India at US Soybean Export Council (USSEC).

The agricultural sector contributes 25 per cent to overall GHG emissions. Going ahead, agri startups need to focus on providing affordable and innovative solutions while reducing food wastages, improving agri supply chain efficiency and minimising carbon footprints said, Ashok Varma, Partner, PwC.

Pankaj K Dwivedi, Head of BD & Agronomy, nurture.farm highlighted that the burden of sustaining food systems needs to be distributed instead of cantered on farmers. All the major stakeholders need to look for simple and implementable solutions.

FICCI-PwC Knowledge report ‘AgTech: A smarter route to sustainable agriculture’ was released during the event.

Key highlights of the Knowledge report

FICCI PwC Knowledge report emphasises that the requirement for food is growing year on year however the land area producing the crops are more or less the same. The world is going to face a challenge in ensuring food availability for approx. 9.73 billion people by 2050 while sustaining the environment at the same time. The solution to this lies in innovative and smart technological solutions for increasing crop production and maintaining ecological balance.

In addition, climate change poses a severe threat to crop yield and thus ensuring food security is going to be a challenge in the future. Agriculture alone contributes to 25 per cent of GHGs emissions and it becomes exigent to adopt and promote agricultural practices that ensure food security while conserving the environment at the same time.

The report recommends a four-pronged ‘UDAI’ approach for achieving sustainable agriculture through agritech startups

India is one of the most vulnerable countries to the physical risks of climate change in Asia. And it is already visible, thanks to erratic and incessant rains, frequent cases of droughts and cyclones, and extended winters. The agriculture sector is sensitive to these changes and new trends in weather patterns. The major fallout is crop loss, which causes huge distress to the economically weaker section of farmers and the rural population dependent on farming activities. Over 86 per cent of farmers in India hold below five acres of land and the crops they grow are mostly used for personal consumption. This makes their livelihood highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change.

There is a need to take a slew of measures to protect small and marginal farmers in India from the ill effects of climate change. There are concerns that Indian agriculture overuses water resources despite the country being in the league of water-deficient countries. Farming’s share is 90 per cent of total consumed water. However, some reports suggest 32 per cent of water used in farm operations is utilised effectively while the rest goes waste, due to the haphazard use of water, especially through flood irrigation. Judicious use of water is a key to making our agriculture climate resilient.

Improvement and expansion of the irrigation system can enhance water use efficiency and reduce the negative effect of climate change on water availability for agriculture. Even today, more than half of the agricultural land in India is rainfed. And flood irrigation is primarily used for winter crops. There is a lack of awareness about the importance of micro irrigation even though it offers up to 90 per cent water efficiency compared to 35 per cent for flood irrigation. Farmers must be convinced to take benefit of government schemes and adopt micro irrigation.

Piped irrigation system will not just help farmers save on input costs but enhance crop productivity and help make agriculture sustainable and climate resilient.

The adoption of remote sensing technology can give farmers real-time information on water productivity, which is a crucial element for climate-resilient agriculture. We also need to stress effective water management through rainwater harvesting and the reuse and recycling of greywater. Farmers can easily store runoff rainwater in tanks or farm ponds and use it when rains become sporadic.

Reports are coming from different parts of the country that the salinity and droughts are impairing crop productivity, and thus leading to farm distress. Both these conditions arise from and get aggravated by climate change. Thus, farmers must be encouraged to adopt good agricultural practices. They must seek good quality salt-tolerant, and water-use efficient seeds and incorporate innovative solutions to defend their crops from biotic as well as abiotic stresses. There is a need to create awareness to encourage farmers to diversify their crop baskets and grow climate-resilient varieties.

Post-harvest losses are a major concern as they can undo the months of efforts taken to produce crops. If robust storage and transport infrastructure are created, farmers can store their crops for a longer time and can sell them off for fair prices in areas they are in demand. The sudden changes in weather patterns put the crop harvest at great risk of getting spoilt. We must build a network of warehouses and cold storage that is easily accessible and affordable to farmers. Moreover, strong market linkages and food processing units need to be developed as a part of post-harvest agricultural adaptation. This will minimise crop losses, strengthen rural livelihoods and make Indian agriculture climate-resilient.

The government of India has been taking several measures to strengthen the farming community through dedicated schemes. Crop insurance is among them and is very important for protecting farmers from the negative impacts of climate change. However, many farmers in the country are still not using the crop insurance scheme, which acts as a safety net amid unpredictable weather patterns. Climate change can reduce arm incomes by up to 25 per cent, warned the economic survey in 2017-18. Thus, we need to fortify every segment in the agriculture sector– from pre-sowing to farming operations to post-harvest—as we seek to make our agriculture climate-resilient.

Telangana Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao (File Photo).

Warangal: In a blistering attack on the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Union government, Chief Minister K Chandrashekhar Rao on Saturday tore into the unfounded criticism levelled by BJP Ministers against Telangana, and listed out categorically how the country’s youngest State had bettered other States on every front, and was in fact, providing leadership to the nation.

Speaking after inaugurating the Prathima Relief Institute of Medical Sciences, Medical College and Hospital in Warangal, the Chief Minister pointed out how Union Ministers would come here, level baseless allegations against the State government and two days after returning to Delhi, announce awards for the State appreciating its schemes.

Calling out the political emptiness behind such allegations, Rao said every promise he made during the Telangana Statehood movement was kept, and that Telangana had already become the richest State in the country. In fact, the per capita income in Telangana was higher than of Maharashtra which had Mumbai, the financial capital of India.

“Telangana’s GSDP growth and per capita power utilisation is higher than others. It is a proud achievement that Telangana is ahead of all in every sector and is providing leadership to the nation,” the Chief Minister said.

Condemning the politics of hate and divisiveness, Chandrashekhar Rao said some negative forces were trying to propagate the politics of hate, and asked the youth to be cautious of such undesired elements which could do severe damage to the State’s secular fabric.

“Ours is a great nation, known for its tolerance. The nation is for the welfare of all. But some people, to fulfill their vested interests, are trying to plant poisonous seeds in the minds of the people. This is not acceptable in any manner. This is not good for the society,” he said, asking the students to keep an eye on what was happening around them and to be cautious.

Also talking about the unique natural wealth of India, the Chief Minister said India was ‘Annapurna’ to the world.

“Even in America, three times bigger than India, only 29 percent of land is suitable for agriculture, while China, twice our size, only 16 percent of land is suitable for agriculture. In India, 50 per cent of available land area is suitable for agriculture, apart from 70,000 TMC of water flowing in India’s rivers,” he said, adding that however, even when India had such abundant natural resources, people here preferred McDonald’s pizzas and burgers, while the approach of the Union government was such that thousands of farmers were forced to stage protests against anti-farmer laws and policies.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TS-CM-KCR.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/telangana-setting-leadership-goals-cm-kcr

Safety of agricultural produce and environmental contamination is at risk due to the rampant use of four highly hazardous pesticides (HHP), according to a recent report. Unapproved and unauthorised use of the agrochemicals — chlorpyrifos, fipronil, atrazine and paraquat — was found across the country.

The report, titled State Of Chlorpyrifos, Fipronil, Atrazine And Paraquat Dichloride In India, was developed by Pesticide Action Network (PAN), a non-profit that works on eliminating human and environmental hazards caused by pesticides.

It was released by Indian Council of Agricultural Research emeritus professor P Indira Devi August 11, 2022, at an event in Thrissur, Kerala. ICAR is the apex body for agricultural research in India.

Central Insecticides Board and Registration Committee, India's pesticides regulator, has approved specific uses of agrochemicals. But state agriculture departments and industries recommended the four chemicals for more crops than their approved use, the study found.

The study said:

Recommendation of these four chemicals for more crops indicates non-compliance with national regulation and promotion of illegal uses.

A field study was conducted in seven states: Andhra Pradesh, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Tamilnadu, Telangana and West Bengal. Pesticide usage and its health effects were studied on 300 respondents, including farmers, farm workers and pesticide retailers.

The HHPs are approved for use in the country for only specific crop-pest combinations. However, they are being used for several food and non-food crops without approval, the study found.

“Chlorpyrifos is approved for 18 crops in India, while the study found it was used for 23 crops. Fipronil is approved for nine crops but was used in fields for 27 crops,” stated the report. “Similarly, atrazine and paraquat dichloride are approved for one and 11 crops, respectively, but field uses were noted for 19 and 23 crops, respectively.”

Agriculture departments and universities and the pesticide industry also recommended unapproved uses, the study said. “These high numbers of non-approved uses pose serious questions on the safety of agricultural produce and environmental contamination,” it stated.

The maximum residue level (MRL) of agricultural produce is monitored based on approved uses. Non-approved uses largely remain unmonitored for MRLs, a serious food safety concern domestically that also poses a threat to international trade of agriculture commodities, the study said.

“About 40 per cent of total registered pesticides in India qualify to be categorised as highly hazardous pesticides owing to their potential for environmental health damages,” A D Dileep Kumar, the author of the report, told Down To Earth. Kumar is also the chief executive officer of PAN, India.

Pesticide use and practices documented in this study indicate serious lacuna in regulation and accountability, Kumar said.

“This points to poor governance of pesticide management in India that results in exposure of farmers and workers, contamination of agricultural produce and environmental pollution. About 20 per cent farmers and 44 per cent workers who participated in the study reported exposure and poor health,” the report author said.

Safe use of pesticides can never happen in India given its agro-ecological and climatic conditions, Kumar further said. However, the farming community is often blamed for indiscriminate, injudicious and unsafe use of pesticides.

“A recent pesticide residue analysis conducted by Kerala Agriculture University revealed the presence of chlorpyrifos residues above the prescribed maximum level in 19 food commodities, all are marked as non-recommended for the use of pesticide,” the report said.

This indicates widespread indiscriminate use. Use of paraquat dichloride has also been reported from Kerala in several crop and non-crop settings, stated the report.

The “inherent toxicity, as well as the widespread unsafe and non-approved use” of the four pesticides, should be considered and banned, the study said. Monitoring pesticide residues in farm produce and environmental samples to understand the level and extent of contamination was also recommended.

(HT)

The study, done by the Telangana State Development and Planning Society (TSDPS) under department of planning, analysed the rainfall situation in the region during the south-west and north-east monsoon seasons since 1952.

It observed that there has been a steady increase in the rainfall pattern in the region in the last three decades, but for a couple of dry spell years.

“It is a decadal change. In fact, the entire India, particularly the peninsular region, has been witnessing an increase in the rainfall over the last three decades,” weather expert and former deputy director general of India meteorological department (IMD) Dr Y V Rama Rao told HT.

During July this year, several parts of Telangana witnessed continues wet spell between July 9 and 14, where heavy to very heavy with extreme heavy rainfall occurred over Nirmal, Nizamabad, Adilabad, Kumuram Bheem, Mancherial, Karimnagar, Jagtial, Jayashankar and Suryapet districts.

At least 25 places recorded more than 200 mm of rainfall in a single day during this five-day period, resulting in heavy flooding to Godavari river, its tributaries and several streams, wreaking havoc in these districts.

The highest rainfall of 391 mm occurred at Jainoor in Kumaram Bheem district on July 13, followed by 384 mm at Kerameri and 352.4 mm at Sirpur-II in the same district on the same day. Similar extreme heavy rainfall was witnessed on July 10, 12 and 14.

“The highest rainfall witnessed in a gap of 24 hours in the region in the last three decades, however, was 51.7 cm in Mulugu district on July 19, 2013, followed by 50.3 cm in Kumaram Bheem district on July 23 in the same year,” the report said.

Rao, who is also a consultant for the TSDPS, attributed this unusually high rainfall in the region to climate change caused largely on account of greenhouse gases-induced warming. “They absorb the heat and obstruct the clouds, resulting in high rainfall. Another reason could be La Nina effect that causes low pressure resulting in heavy rains,” he said.

The report also said regional anthropogenic forcing such as from aerosols and changes in land use patterns due to urbanisation which enhance the local convection in association with the favourable synoptic conditions also led to heavy rainfall.

The report said Telangana receives 80.4% (739.1 mm) of the annual rainfall merely from south-west monsoon season while the northeast monsoon contributes 12.2% (113.2 mm) of the annual rainfall. The highest rainfall is generally witnessed in northern and eastern parts of the state in June, July, August and September, compared to southern Telangana.

It said the annual rainy days in Telangana are 62 with south-west monsoon season accounting to 48. The highest annual rainy days are observed from extreme eastern districts with the highest over Bhadradri Kothagudem (82 days) and Mulugu (76 days) followed by Kumuram Bheem (74 days) and lowest over southern districts of Jogulamba Gadwal (48 days) followed by Wanaparthy & Hyderabad (52 days).

The TSDPS report said July (24.9%) accounts for the highest contribution from the south-west monsoon rainfall, followed by August (23.7%), September (17.7 %) and June (14.1%) respectively.

During the period from 1951 to 2022, the highest mean rainfall of 1,351.1 mm was received in 1983-84 due to excess rainfall of 53 per cent during the south-west monsoon and 117 percent excess during the northeast monsoon. The lowest rainfall in this 70-year period was 559.3 mm was received in 1972-73.

“These rainfall patterns will help the state augment water resources in the state and agricultural management,” the report said.

160,A rain dampener for kharif crops this monsoon poses price risks,2022-08-24 22:36:40+05:30,[],"['price', 'rainfall', 'food', 'crops', 'states', 'sowing', 'kharif', 'rice', 'monsoon', 'risks', 'dampener', 'remains', 'rain', 'poses', 'production', 'uttar']","Most of the kharif sowing is completed by mid-August.
Rice sowing was delayed due to uneven rainfall initially last year as well, but rice sowing had reached its last 5-year average by end-July.
This time around, an extended delay in rice sowing means an overall decline in rice acreage.
While the situation is not yet alarming, the uneven distribution of rainfall remains a key challenge to be kept under watch for the risks it poses.
Not only has the mean monsoon rainfall declined, but also extreme precipitation events and dry spells have increased.","The patchy progress of the southwest monsoon this year has cast a long shadow on India’s kharif crop produce, particularly of rice, which is an important constituent of the government’s food distribution programmes. The threat comes right after wheat production in the rabi season took a hit from heatwaves and at a time when global rice supplies are at risk in major foodgrain exporting countries.

The southwest monsoon season runs from June to September and typically provides around three-fourths of the country’s annual rainfall. Most of the kharif sowing is completed by mid-August.

The problem is not overall precipitation as much as the distribution of the southwest monsoon rains. As of 23 August, rains were 9% above the long period average (LPA) at the national level. The La Nina effect, expected to persist until year-end, augurs well for precipitation during the rest of India’s monsoon season.

Yet, distribution has been uneven. Rainfall has been deficient in Uttar Pradesh (45% below the LPA), Manipur (43% below), Bihar (42%), Jharkhand (28%), Tripura (28%), West Bengal (20%) and Nagaland (20%).

Irrigation availability provides some relief. However, in Uttar Pradesh, high irrigation cover (81% against the national average of 54.3%) is insufficient for rice (which has very high water dependency) amid the state’s large rainfall deficit. Note that the rice-sowing season is virtually over.

The country’s rain-deficit states together account for around 30% of our kharif foodgrain production and horticulture output.

Data for horticulture is not available as widely as for foodgrains, nor on a timely basis. Many horticulture items, especially vegetables, are grown mostly by small and marginal farmers, and on farms of small acreage.

The supply of such produce has an impact on general price levels in India. In the Consumer Price Index (CPI) food basket, inflation of fruits and vegetables (horticulture items) was in double digits (12.3%) in the April-June quarter.

Some states are more dependent on agriculture than others. The share of agriculture of Tripura (27.5%), Uttar Pradesh (22.3%), West Bengal (19.5%) and Bihar (19.0%) in the overall economy is higher than the national average. Poor agricultural performance in these states could hurt their economic performance disproportionately.

Overall, kharif is still lagging last year’s levels. It remains considerably lower than last year’s (8.3% as on 18 August) for rice due to reduced sowing in eight of the top 10 rice-producing states, led by West Bengal and Uttar Pradesh.

Rice sowing was delayed due to uneven rainfall initially last year as well, but rice sowing had reached its last 5-year average by end-July.

This time around, an extended delay in rice sowing means an overall decline in rice acreage.

To be sure, despite some reduction in the central pool of rice stock, it remains comfortably above the buffer norms. Against a requirement of 13.54 million tonnes as on 1 July, the Food Corporation of India had rice stock of 31.71 million tonnes. But due to lower acreage and subsequently lower production, this gap is expected to narrow going ahead. Whether the situation becomes bad enough to lead to curb in rice exports remains to be seen.

Domestically, rice prices have already started firming up. The wholesale price of rice on average (across 60 cities in four zones) rose 1.3% on-month in July, with some cities reporting a double-digit increase. Typically, wholesale prices of rice decline or remain stable on-month in July. This July, West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar (the larger kharif producers among the rain-deficient states) recorded the largest increase in retail cereal prices.

At the same time, nine states have received excess to large excess rainfall. Major crop growers Tamil Nadu and Telangana have received rainfall 67% and 57% above the LPA, respectively.

Parts of Maharashtra recently reported crop losses due to excess rainfall. Such crop damage in other states which are receiving excess rainfall, therefore, remains monitorable.

A shortfall in food production could fuel India’s already-high food inflation. While the situation is not yet alarming, the uneven distribution of rainfall remains a key challenge to be kept under watch for the risks it poses.

Climate change has impacted rainfall and therefore agricultural production over the years. Not only has the mean monsoon rainfall declined, but also extreme precipitation events and dry spells have increased.

India was buffeted by five cyclones last year, three of which were in the severe and above categories. As for the season as a whole, the country received normal southwest monsoon.

According to the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (CRI), which is based on extreme weather events such as storms, floods and heatwaves in a year, India is among the world’s most vulnerable countries. The country ranked seventh on the CRI in 2019, compared with 31st in 2010.

The rising frequency of extreme weather events poses a risk to agricultural productivity. It could also make weather forecasts miss the mark and thus hinder planning for crop sowing.

Fruits, vegetables and flowers are part of the Indian culture and there is a need for focused research on medicinal plants as well, said Governor Dr. Tamilisai Soundararajan.

Addressing the students and faculty of Sri Konda Laxman Telangana State Horticultural University (SKLTSHU) at Mulugu in Siddipet district on Friday on the occasion of the second convocation of the university, she said she is happy that a large number of students are taking to agricultural and horticultural courses to serve the farming community and the country.

Horticultural university has a crucial role in enhancing production and productivity of vegetables and fruits which are important components in the balanced diet. The importance and awareness on fruits, vegetables and flowers as also balanced nutrition is felt more during COVID-19 pandemic, the Governor said.

A significant progress is being made in cultivation, marketing and export of horticultural crops, which is a good sign, she said. Earlier generations used to take traditional foods and they did not suffer lifestyle diseases such as blood pressure and diabetes. It’s time to enhance production, productivity and quality of all horticultural crops to make India nutritionally secure and healthy, she said.

Deputy Director General (Horticultural Sciences) of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research (ICAR) Anand Kumar Singh, the chief guest at the convocation, said in view of the climate change challenges, science and technology has a crucial role to play in increasing production, productivity and quality of agricultural and horticultural crops.

Cultivation of crops having market demand, reducing post-harvest losses in addition to use of the cutting-edge technologies such as like artificial intelligence, robotics, drones, genome editing, biotechnology and genetic engineering are the need of the hour, Dr. Singh said. Highest productivity with lowest input resources should be the aim of researchers, he suggested.

The COP 26 climate summit in Glasgow made some progress in a number of areas but not enough. The world still remains off track to beat back the climate crisis. Recognising the urgency of the challenge, member countries all over the world agreed that they should come back next year to submit stronger 2030 emission reduction targets with the aim of closing the gap to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

They also agreed that developed countries should urgently deliver more resources to help climate-vulnerable countries adapt to the dangerous and costly consequences of climate change that they are already experiencing from dwindling crop yields to devastating storms. The countries also made commitments to curb methane emissions, align the finance sector with net-zero by 2050, accelerate phasing out coal, barring a few countries, curb international financing for fossil fuel and halt forest deforestation/degradation etc, stressing collective global action to address the crisis.

Inter-connected Solution

Climate crisis is intertwined with other complex issues, therefore, we require a multi-pronged, inter-connected climate solution. Forests are one of them. Forests have a crucial role to play in enabling the world to meet the SDGs, including those related to biodiversity conservation, livelihoods, food security, mitigating natural risks, and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Forests, which are home to 80% terrestrial wildlife, are at this intersection. They absorb a net 7.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide a year.

A recent study found that their biophysical aspects have a tendency to cool the Earth by an additional 0.5%. The conservation of forests, along with other nature-based solutions, can provide up to 37% of the emission reductions needed to tackle climate change. Another study estimated that annual gross carbon emissions from tropical tree cover loss between 2015 and 2017 was equivalent to 4.8 billion tonnes. This causes more emissions each year than 85 million cars do in their lifetime. In 2019, about 34% of the total net anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions came from the energy sector, 24% from industry, 22% from agriculture, forestry and other land use, 15% from transport and 6% from buildings.

Emissions Gap

The ‘Emissions Gap Report 2022: The Closing Window’ released ahead of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP 27) in Egypt, said the international community is still falling far short of Paris goals with no credible pathway to limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius in place. It said at 2.4 tCO2e (tonne carbon dioxide equivalent), India’s per capita GHG emissions (including land use, land-use change and forestry) stood far below the world average of 6.3 tCO2e in 2020.

The US remains far above this level at 14 tCO2 e, followed by Russia at 13, China 9.7, Brazil and Indonesia 7.5 and the European union at 7.2 tCO2e. Per capita emissions range widely across G20 members. Emissions of India are about half of the G20 average whereas Saudi Arabia reaches more than twice the G20, the report said. It mentioned that despite the decisions by all countries in Glasgow to strengthen Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and some updates from nations, progress has been woefully inadequate.

India updated its NDC in August and committed to reducing emissions intensity of its GDP by 45% from the 2005 level and achieving about 50% cumulative electric power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based resources by 2030. The updated NDC reads, “To put forward and further propagate a healthy and sustainable way of living based on traditions and values of conservation and moderation, including through a mass movement for LIFE – Lifestyle for Environment, as a key to combating climate change”. The updated NDC also represents the framework for India’s transition to cleaner energy for the period 2021-2030.

Narrow Moment

The world has only a narrow moment to pursue action to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of the climate crisis and seize economic opportunity. Critical ecosystems – terrestrial and coastal ecosystems including forests, mangroves, wetlands and grasslands –that are biologically rich, are essential to humanity and serve important carbon sinks; for example, the Amazon forests represent some of the most biodiverse parts of the planet. In addition to serving as significant carbon sinks, these ecosystems benefit the global population with a wealth of services, including providing a source of food and medicines, regulating local temperature and reducing vulnerability to extreme weather etc.

As per the State of the World’s Forests, 2022, of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization, nearly one-third of the planet’s land has been transformed in the last 60 years and nearly 90% of the deforestation between 2000 and 2019 was related to agriculture. Deforestation poses a serious threat to biodiversity because it leads to a disproportionate loss of species distributions, increasing the risk of extinction. That, in some cases, deforestation is irreversible and in others, recovery might be very slow is of great concern and reinforces the need to halt deforestation as a means for addressing climate change.

Halting deforestation and preventing forest degradation is one of the most important actions for reducing GHG emissions and removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. As per FAO 2019, biodiversity is indispensable for food security, sustainable development and the supply of ecosystem services. The WWF report ‘Living Planet Report’ 2022, is a wake-up call to the world as it points out that there is a decline of 69% in wildlife population across the world during 1970-2018. This staggering rate of downfall is yet another reaffirmation that our planet is in the throes of a biodiversity crisis. To reverse the trend of biodiversity loss, a transformative change is needed to tackle its root causes – the interconnected economic, sociocultural, demographic, political, institutional and technological drivers.

The world’s forests and forest soils annually store more than one trillion tonnes of carbon, twice the amount floating free in the atmosphere. Destruction of forests through deforestation or fire adds billions of tonnes of carbon into the atmosphere each year. Forests are intricately linked to climate change, both as a cause and solution. Therefore, world leaders should not only take a pledge at COP 27 but also immediate action to halt deforestation and maintain forest ecosystem services to benefit climate, biodiversity, health and long-term food security.

The exception is Egypt, where even slight amounts of global warming potentially lead to large increases in drought probability, the researchers found.

Researchers from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK found that even a modest temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius will spell serious consequences in India, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Brazil and Egypt.

By PTI Published Date - 02:00 PM, Wed - 28 September 22

New Delhi: Rising global temperatures may lead to more frequent and longer-lasting droughts in India, while posing significant risks to people and ecosystems around the world, according to a study.

Researchers from the University of East Anglia (UEA) in the UK found that even a modest temperature increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius will spell serious consequences in India, China, Ethiopia, Ghana, Brazil and Egypt.

The study, published recently in the journal Climatic Change, quantified the projected impacts of alternative levels of global warming upon the probability and length of severe drought in the six countries.

“Current pledges for climate change mitigation, which are projected to still result in global warming levels of 3 degrees Celsius or more, would impact all the countries in this study,” said Jeff Price, Associate Professor of Biodiversity and Climate Change at UEA,.

“For example, with 3 degrees Celsius warming, more than 50 per cent of the agricultural area in each country is projected to be exposed to severe droughts lasting longer than one year in a 30-year period,” Price said in a statement.

Using standard population projections, the researchers estimated that 80 per cent to 100 per cent of the population in Brazil, China, Egypt, Ethiopia and Ghana, are projected to be exposed to a severe drought lasting one year or longer in a 30-year period.

For India, nearly 50 per cent of the population is projected to be exposed to a severe drought lasting one year or longer in a 30-year period, they said.

In contrast, the study found that meeting the long-term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement, that is limiting warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, is projected to greatly benefit all of the countries in this study.

Meeting the target will greatly reduce exposure to severe drought for large percentages of the population and in all major land cover classes, with Egypt potentially benefiting the most, the researchers said.

In the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario, the drought probability is projected to triple in Brazil and China, nearly double in Ethiopia and Ghana, increase slightly in India, and substantially increase in Egypt, they said.

The study found that in a 2 degrees Celsius warming scenario, the probability of drought is projected to quadruple in Brazil and China, double in Ethiopia and Ghana, reach greater than 90 per cent probability in Egypt, and nearly double in India.

In a 3 degrees Celsius warming scenario, the probability of drought projected to be in Brazil and China is 30-40 per cent; 20-23 per cent in Ethiopia and Ghana; 14 per cent in India but nearly 100 per cent in Egypt, according to the researchers.

In a 4 degrees Celsius warming scenario, the probability of drought projected in Brazil and China is nearly 50 per cent; 27-30 per cent in Ethiopia and Ghana; nearly 20 per cent in India; and 100 per cent in Egypt, they said.

In most countries, the study found that the projected increase in drought probability increases approximately linearly with increasing temperature. The exception is Egypt, where even slight amounts of global warming potentially lead to large increases in drought probability, the researchers found.

“Not only does the area exposed to drought increase with global warming, but it also increases the length of the droughts,” said Professor Rachel Warren, who led the study.

“In Brazil, China, Ethiopia, and Ghana droughts of longer than two years are projected to occur even in a 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario,” Warren added.

The percentage of land projected to be exposed to a severe drought of longer than 12 months in a 30-year period is expected to increase rapidly by the 1.5 degrees Celsius warming scenario in Brazil, China and Egypt, and in areas of permanent snow and ice in India.

“India and China both have large areas currently under ‘permanent’ ice and snow cover. However, in the 3 degrees Celsius warming scenario, 90 per cent of these areas are projected to face severe droughts lasting longer than a year in a 30-year period,” the authors of the study said.

“These areas form the headwaters of many major river systems, and thus the water supply for millions of people downstream. Increasing probability and duration of severe drought points to potential declines in water storage in the Chinese Himalayas in the form of snow and ice,” they added.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Warming-may-lead-to-more-frequent-longer-lasting-droughts-in-India-Study.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/warming-may-lead-to-more-frequent-longer-lasting-droughts-in-india-study

It was followed by the keynote address of Prof. Rajeev Varshney. Prof. Varshney demonstrated how genomics delivers improved crop varieties to the farmers and how genome sequencing of pearl millet played a role in accentuating India’s contribution to millet genome sequencing. Prasad described how millets could serve as a source of informative genes useful for climate-resilient agriculture.

He demonstrated an example of a small heat shock protein-encoding gene isolated from foxtail millet, which conferred tolerance to heat stress when overexpressed in rice. Students who attended the talks were very interactive and asked several interesting questions to both speakers.

Later, ICRISAT Principal Scientist Dr Mani Vetriventhan, delivered a talk on why germplasm conservation is essential. From his speech, students realized the importance of conserving the seeds for the future. Parallelly, the competitions were held at different venues in the SLS and CIS.

HYDERABAD: In continuation of its efforts to encourage the High-Density Plantation System (HDPS) in the cultivation of cotton on a large scale, the State government may favour the cultivation of cotton not just in the Kharif season but also in Rabi.

Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy, while interacting with the media at his official residence in Hyderabad on Sunday, said that cotton could be cultivated both in Kharif and Rabi seasons as being done in countries like the US and Brazil. He said that during his recent visit to the US to study various aspects of HDPS in cotton at various fields in Austin, Texas, it was seen that they were harvesting cotton even when the temperature was reaching 44 degrees Celsius. Considering the climate aspect, he has expressed hope of cultivating cotton in Telangana during the Rabi season as well.

He said that experts on the subject were deliberating on the various possibilities and based on the report which will be submitted to Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao, a decision to that effect would be taken, and soon a high-level meeting will be held to discuss the matter. He also observed that there was an opportunity to cultivate cotton on one crore acres in the State.

Referring to reports of damages to cotton, maize and soya crops during the recent floods, he said that most of the farmers had just sown the seeds and the “losses will not be huge”.

Even in countries with massive numbers of undernourished people, such as in India, harvests are moving away from crops for direct food consumption.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 12:30 AM, Wed - 28 September 22

By Deepak K Ray

It’s sometimes bandied about that enough food is grown globally to feed everyone now and into the future. Undernourishment is ‘just a distribution challenge’. And it’s mostly true: enough kilojoules do and will be harvested in just the top ten global crops, which account for more than 80% of all calories. We will grow an extra 14,000 trillion kilocalories (around 59,000 trillion kilojoules) by 2030.

Also Read Opinion: Return of geopolitics in Europe

But while distribution is certainly one challenge, under the hood things are not so simple; all harvested crops are not for direct food consumption.

Crops are often consumed with little to no processing, such as apples from the tree and tortillas made from the flour of a wheat or maize crop. But there are another six reasons crops are grown: animal feed (for dairy, eggs and meat production); the food processing industry (think high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oil and modified starch); exports (to countries that can pay); industrial use (think ethanol, bio-diesel, bagasse, bio-plastics, and pharmaceuticals); seeds; and then there are crop losses. The last two categories are relatively small, though in the 2010s crop losses were still relatively high in Africa.

SDG Target

The second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) is to end hunger and provide nutritious and sufficient food (that is, sufficient calories) to all people, all year round, by 2030. This is a huge target: up to 828 million now do not get sufficient quantities of food each day, mostly in Asia and Africa. The number of undernourished people globally has risen since 2015 and has been intensified by Covid-19.

Since the 1960s, the fraction of crops harvested for direct food consumption has decreased. Those grown for other usages, especially those for processing, exports and industrial usage, increased. In addition, yields of food crops have remained persistently lower and are increasing at a slower rate. Industrial-use crops are currently twice as productive as food crops.

We seem to be on target to a situation when only around a quarter of the calories harvested globally in 2030 will be for direct food consumption. A third may feed livestock and be used in the food processing industry; 15% may get diverted to industrial usage; and around a fifth will be exported.

Direct Consumption

Only in the continent of Africa are crops predominantly harvested for direct food consumption. Even in countries with massive numbers of undernourished people, such as in India, harvests are moving away from crops for direct food consumption. Specific regions around the world have specialised into harvesting crops for usage other than direct food consumption, quite different from how the world was 50 years ago. People with insecure access to food are being left behind, especially where they are also trapped in poverty. Agriculture is responding more to the demands of a growing global middle class and its alternative crop uses; agriculture is working less for the undernourished and the poor.

So how can the world solve the food insecurity challenge? Much of the corn (maize) harvest in the United States goes to alternative uses and so diverting it to food-insecure nations seems obvious. But that corn is not a variety suitable for human consumption. And what will then happen to livestock farmers or those working in the industries that require this raw input? The thinking that the world has and will have enough calories to feed everyone is a chimera: all harvested crops are not for the same use even when the crop is the same.

Alternately, we can increase crop production. This is continuously happening, but at what cost? In Brazil, mapped locations of loss of natural landscape appear to coincide with where crops are grown for the food processing industry. In Indonesia and Malaysia it appears to have been for the export market.

Organisations and governments are striving to increase yields (ostensibly of food crops) in food insecure countries. But the often-touted ‘yield-gap’ — the difference between the best performing countries and others, when factors such as climate and soils are taken into consideration — is somewhat misleading. American maize yields are several times those in Africa. But it is used for animal feed, processing and industrial usage versus food in Africa. When higher profit can be made from alternative uses, it will happen.

So in reality countries with food-insecure populations and with poverty will have to fend for themselves or import food crops. But how will that be even possible? Will they be able to compete in the open market? Or compete for donations? To grow food for food-insecure countries, will a farmer in Minnesota be forced to switch from corn to wheat? Will a wheat farmer in Western Australia or the UK be asked to try a new crop? Will a sugarcane farmer in India be forced to grow rice? These are tricky questions, but the development of high resolution maps showing the purpose of harvesting our lands and how it changed over time and its trajectory will help us manage multiple purposes: of reaching the second SDG; profitable agriculture for our farmers; supporting the middle class, and the agri-industry.

Fraction Used for Food

Otherwise, at current rates of yield improvements in food crops, 31 countries will likely not be able to sufficiently feed their population from within-country crop production by 2030. Another 17 countries will likely not be able to feed their expected extra population in 2030 from their within-country crop production.

We also do not know the lingering effects of Covid disruption, the war in Ukraine, regime change and conflicts in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and climate change on food security in 2030. The World Food Program estimates that currently 811 million people are hungry and the Food and Agriculture Organization projects that 670 million could be hungry in 2030.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals were agreed in September 2015 by 193 nations – the entire world. In 2022, we are nearly half way through to the goal year of 2030. Eight percent of the world population is predicted to be hungry in 2030, which is the same as when the SDGs were launched. Given the way things stand, without an extra effort in the 50 or so challenged nations, the world will together fail to end hunger. Elsewhere it is the relatively ‘simple’ matter of crop use and distribution.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Crop.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-non-food-crops-eating-up-our-food

The roll-out of the Centre’s new integrated food security scheme is set to begin on January 1, 2023. As per the decision made by the cabinet, led by Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, the new scheme would provide free foodgrains to 81.35 crore beneficiaries under National Food Security Act (NFSA) 2013, for the year 2023. The scheme would also ensure effective and uniform implementation of NFSA, Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food & Public Distribution said in a statement today.

Under NFSA-2013, the Government of India has a social and legal commitment to the people of the nation- a dignified life by ensuring them access to food and nutritional security through the availability of an adequate quantity of quality foodgrains. For fulfilling this commitment to the most vulnerable 67 per cent of the population i.e. 81.35 crore persons covered under NFSA, the cabinet decided to launch a new Central sector scheme to fulfill the vision of One Nation – One Price – One Ration.

Under the scheme, the Government of India will provide free foodgrains to all NFSA beneficiaries i.e. Antyodaya Ann Yojana (AAY) households and Priority Household (PHH) persons for the next year through the widespread network of 5.33 lakhs fair price shops across the country. The decision will strengthen the provisions of NFSA, 2013 in terms of accessibility, affordability and availability of foodgrains for the poor, the ministry further said.

The new integrated scheme will subsume two current food subsidy schemes of the Department of Food and Public Distribution- a) Food Subsidy to Food Corporation of India (FCI) for NFSA, and b) Food Subsidy for decentralised procurement for states, dealing with procurement, allocation and delivery of free foodgrains to the states under NFSA.

Free foodgrains will concurrently ensure uniform implementation of portability under the One Nation One Ration Card (ONORC) across the country and will further strengthen this choice-based platform. Central Government will bear the food subsidy of more than Rs. 2 lakh crores for the year 2023. The new scheme is aimed at bringing uniformity and clarity to food security under NFSA at the beneficiary level.

To implement the decision on the ground

Secretary, Food & Public Distribution (DFPD) has taken a meeting with all state food secretaries on 29.12.2022. The issues related to the distribution of free foodgrains were discussed including technical resolutions. All states and union territories (UTs) are assured to implement the free foodgrain scheme from 1st January 2023.

Notification of modified Schedule-I reflecting zero price of foodgrains for AAY and PHH beneficiaries from 1st January 2023 to 31st December 2023 has been issued today and shared with the states and UTs.

Also, an order is issued for all general managers of FCI to visit three ration shops every day in different areas of their jurisdiction mandatorily from 01.01.2023 to 07.01.2023 and submit a report to the DFPD nodal officer on a daily basis, in the given format for review and taking corrective action.

In view of free foodgrains, an advisory is also issued to the states and UTs on the mechanism to provide dealers’ margins for distributing foodgrains to the beneficiaries.

India marks 75 years of her independence August 15, 2022. In these 75 years, it has become a fully-functional democracy.

A democracy is all about the power of the people. Down To Earth celebrates the power of the people of India by presenting a collection of 10 villages and districts across India where people have worked to radically improve their lot through better solutions for drinking water and sanitation.

Ibrahimpur village (also considered a Gram Panchayat) lies in Narayanraopet block, Siddipet district, Telangana.

It was the first model village in the state to practise grey water management by construction of soak pits in individual household premises.

Ibrahimpur village has 273 households and a population of 1,200. Grey water from kitchens and bathrooms led to open drains, causing stagnation of wastewater in the village.

During heavy showers, overflowing drains, wastewater stagnation and inaccessible pathways were a common sight.

Dumping of solid waste on village roads made the situation worse. Mosquito breeding was common and cases of dengue and malaria were noted during the monsoons.

The change

The state and the district worked together to develop a strategy for management of grey water in the village. In 2014, in view of the health effects of grey-water management, Finance Minister of Telangana Tanneru Harish Rao adopted the village.

In 2015, a pilot soak pit was constructed at water-collection points (hand pumps and overhead tanks) where there was water stagnation.

The soak pit ensured that there was no water stagnation around water-usage points. In the same year, post-construction of pilot soak pit, district officials geared up to create awareness campaigns in the village with the support of political leadership, self-help and youth groups.

Yellareddy, ex-member of Gram Panchayat, motivated individual households to construct magic soak pits and communities to plant saplings near the soak pits. Every household constructed a soak pit within four to five months after construction of the pilot soak pit.

Overall, 273 individual soak pits and three community soak pits were constructed in 2015–16. The magic soak pits are constructed along with inspection chambers, which trap solid waste entering the soak pit.

The soak pits are covered to prevent debris from entering. Swachh Bharat Mission (Grameen) officials helped local masons design and construct the soak pits.

The roads of Ibrahimpur are clean and without any visible solid waste. The streets have plants and trees on either side.

In 2013-14, before the soak pits were constructed, around 50-60 per cent of the population suffered from diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea and viral fever. This year — 2022 — the figure has come down to just 1 per cent.

All the open drains have been covered in the village. Households also allow rainwater from the roof into the soak pits in order to improve the groundwater recharge in the area.

The village is entirely dependent on groundwater for its potable and non-potable uses and this has helped make their water source sustainable.

Funds from the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS) were used for the construction of soak pits. In 2015, the fund allocated under this scheme for the construction was Rs 4,450, this was increased in November 2021 to Rs 6,500 per soak pit.

Likewise, the cost allocation for the community soak pits was also increased from Rs 14,420 per soak pit to Rs 16,500 per soak pit.

The fund allocation was revised in November 2021 keeping in view the increased cost of construction materials and labourers. This increase in allocation also motivated the communities to construct soak pits.

The implementation programme for soak pits was scaled up to the district level. The district authorities, with the support of the panchayats and communities in the villages, constructed 49,151 magic soak pits by the February 2022 out of 56,393 sanctioned so far.

Operation and maintenance

Household owners take care of individual soak pits. They monitor the inspection chamber constructed before the soak pits. An overflow from this chamber indicates that the soak pit is clogged.

The owner then cleans the soak pit to make it functional. Mandal Panchayat officials convey awareness messages to the communities about periodic cleaning. The Gram Panchayat cleans the community soak pits whenever the soak pits are clogged and non-functional.

In a letter to Union irrigation secretary Pankaj Kumar on Wednesday, Telangana special chief secretary (irrigation) Rajat Kumar said a committee of a technical team comprising of chief engineers from all riparian states — Telangana, AP, Chhattisgarh and Odisha — besides experts from Central Water Commission and National Institute of Hydrology (NIH) may be constituted to study the backwater effects of Polavaram project on the riparian states.

“There is every need for transparency in sharing the data and formulating a sound technical solution acceptable to all,” Kumar said, in the wake of the Centre calling for a meeting of all officials of the riparian states in Delhi on September 29 to study the issue.

In his letter, Kumar expressed apprehension that Telangana would witness massive submergence all along for about 30 km stretch upstream from the Telangana-AP border on either side of the Godavari river due to the Polavaram backwater waters once the project was completed.

He said the CWC had designed the Polavaram project spillway for discharging 50 lakh cusecs against 36 lakh cusecs as envisaged in Godavari Water Disputes Tribunal (GWDT) Award. This would cause much more submergence effect in Telangana, inducing more attenuation of flood peaks.

The Telangana official pointed out that technical studies for backwater effect were carried out by the CWC only for a probable maximum flood of 36 lakh cusecs flood as against designed 50 lakh cusecs. “This would pose threat to the historical temple town of Bhadrachalam with adjoining villages, the critical Manuguru Heavy Water Plant and Bhadradri Thermal plant all upstream of Polavaram,” he said.

Kumar said the technical studies on backwater effect were based on the river cross sections surveyed prior to 1990, but the river course had undergone several changes in the last 30 years due to climate change, land use, sedimentation etc. “So, a fresh survey has to be conducted on the cross sections of the river upstream of Polavaram to assess the correct discharge of river from the project,” he said.

Kumar said the backwater effect of Polavaram would also result in local drainage congestion along the river banks and local streams like Peddavagu, Edullavagu, Pamuleruvagu, Turubakavagu etc joining the river Godavari causing loss and destruction in the areas in Telangana. This would result in submergence of around 60 villages and a huge extent of agricultural lands, he said.

He pointed out the damage caused in the Telangana region during the recent floods to Godavari river in July, due to the completion of Polavaram spillway and upper coffer dam. The inundation continued for five days in the historical temple town and surrounding villages, he said, adding that this would be a recurring phenomenon every year, once the project was completed.

The United States of America allows 84,000 Indian students to study in American Universities annually.","Hyderabad, December 01: Academic Collaborations between Indian and foreign universities are on the rise ever since UGC has come with new guidelines on the same. A case in point is an MoU of Hyderabad based School of Innovation and Management(SoiM), a business school from G. Narayanamma Institute of Technology and Science(for women) which entered an MoU today with the USA-based Saint Louis University, two hundred years old, one of America’s oldest educational institutions. They entered an MoU in the city today at CoWorks of SkyView in Madhapur, Hyderabad. The Agreement was exchanged by Dr Samala Nagaraju, Associate Dean of SoiM and Eric S. Armbrecht, Associate Provost and Director of the Global Education Program at Saint Louis University.

Ashok Kallam, Founder and CEO of Indo Global Studies, which facilitated this and many other global tie-ups and collaborations said NEP 2020(National Education Program) was a welcome initiative and that the removal of restrictions, particularly bureaucratic hurdles, from the field of education mutually benefitting both India and the US on all fronts. This tie-up is one among the many to materialise in near future, he stated.

Speaking further, Ashok Kallam added that most American universities have been exploring their willingness to partner with India on some specific topics of interest – cyber security, healthcare, biotech, artificial intelligence, data sciences, agriculture, climate change and sustainability. Earlier students used to travel to the USA for studies, now, the trend is to study here and there. Now the buzzword is tie-ups and collaborations. Now the new regulations simplified the Tie-ups between Indian and foreign universities and allow students to get ‘dual degrees’ from both foreign and Indian institutes. And they are saving in the process and getting the best of both the countries

The purpose of my maiden visit to Hyderabad is to explore partnerships and collaborations with various educational institutions based out of Hyderabad, said Eric S. Armbrecht. Hyderabad is one of the world’s mega centers for Technology, he said. Saint Louis University chose Hyderabad for my maiden visit among other cities in India because of this reason, The city is most known around the world for its role in advancing technology and human health. You have abundant talent here he said.

We have a lot of similarities between Saint Louis and Hyderabad. Both cities are in the centre of their respective countries. Like you as Technology Hub, we are Innovation Hub for Life Sciences. Like your robust startup ecosystem in this city, we too are a startup nerve centre in the USA. Eric chose Hyderabad first over other cities like Chennai, Mumbai and Delhi, which he is going to explore in the next two weeks for the same.

We have well over 600 Indian students joining us each semester. But 70% of them are from both Telugu states–Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. We would like to double this number.

Another reason for being in Hyderabad is you are a Vaccine Capital of the World. You are also a Pharmacy to the world. You are a Medical Tourism Hub. Post-pandemic Health Care is becoming a major source of employment. Our forte is solving the global problem of escalating healthcare costs. In this mission we would like to identify the right partner for collaboration in the areas of education, research and faculty exchange, he added.

Speaking further Eric, who was in the city at the invitation of Indo Global Studies, added that Saint Louis University is one of the few universities in the world responding to the needs of the skills development of the global workforce. As a part of this, Saint Louis University has come out with a novel product “SLU Experience”. a virtual skill development program through internships, workshops, competitions and events. The program aims at giving hands-down practical experience and learning the four essential skills of the 21st century which any global workforce intending to work in any domain needs. They are 01. Communications and collaborations, 2. Leadership 3. Critical Thinking and 4. Creative Thinking. This is a futuristic program with a future full of promises. We endeavor to train one million learners over the next two to three years program, which is being run across 65 countries across the globe including India.

India with a large portion of its population being young can contribute immensely to the global workforce, India is the tiger in this area.

Eric added that India and the USA are natural allies, especially in education. And he stressed that there is an immense potential to strengthen collaborations between the educational institutions of the two countries. International collaboration begins with mutual interests and a shared commitment to supporting students’ pursuit of career goals and personal ambitions. Saint Louis University is laying a foundation for many collaborations.

The United States of America allows 84,000 Indian students to study in American Universities annually. 44% i.e approximately 33000 students out of 84000 are from both Telugu states–Telangana and Andhra Pradesh. The new trend post the pandemic is many American Universities are offering virtual programs in collaboration with local institutions added Eric

Eric was on a two-day visit to the city. He has already explored Hyderabad Biryani, the dish which is considered synonymous with the city of Hyderabad.

Even in countries with massive numbers of undernourished people, such as in India, harvests are moving away from crops for direct food consumption.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 12:30 AM, Wed - 28 September 22

By Deepak K Ray

It’s sometimes bandied about that enough food is grown globally to feed everyone now and into the future. Undernourishment is ‘just a distribution challenge’. And it’s mostly true: enough kilojoules do and will be harvested in just the top ten global crops, which account for more than 80% of all calories. We will grow an extra 14,000 trillion kilocalories (around 59,000 trillion kilojoules) by 2030.

Also Read Opinion: Return of geopolitics in Europe

But while distribution is certainly one challenge, under the hood things are not so simple; all harvested crops are not for direct food consumption.

Crops are often consumed with little to no processing, such as apples from the tree and tortillas made from the flour of a wheat or maize crop. But there are another six reasons crops are grown: animal feed (for dairy, eggs and meat production); the food processing industry (think high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oil and modified starch); exports (to countries that can pay); industrial use (think ethanol, bio-diesel, bagasse, bio-plastics, and pharmaceuticals); seeds; and then there are crop losses. The last two categories are relatively small, though in the 2010s crop losses were still relatively high in Africa.

SDG Target

The second United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) is to end hunger and provide nutritious and sufficient food (that is, sufficient calories) to all people, all year round, by 2030. This is a huge target: up to 828 million now do not get sufficient quantities of food each day, mostly in Asia and Africa. The number of undernourished people globally has risen since 2015 and has been intensified by Covid-19.

Since the 1960s, the fraction of crops harvested for direct food consumption has decreased. Those grown for other usages, especially those for processing, exports and industrial usage, increased. In addition, yields of food crops have remained persistently lower and are increasing at a slower rate. Industrial-use crops are currently twice as productive as food crops.

We seem to be on target to a situation when only around a quarter of the calories harvested globally in 2030 will be for direct food consumption. A third may feed livestock and be used in the food processing industry; 15% may get diverted to industrial usage; and around a fifth will be exported.

Direct Consumption

Only in the continent of Africa are crops predominantly harvested for direct food consumption. Even in countries with massive numbers of undernourished people, such as in India, harvests are moving away from crops for direct food consumption. Specific regions around the world have specialised into harvesting crops for usage other than direct food consumption, quite different from how the world was 50 years ago. People with insecure access to food are being left behind, especially where they are also trapped in poverty. Agriculture is responding more to the demands of a growing global middle class and its alternative crop uses; agriculture is working less for the undernourished and the poor.

So how can the world solve the food insecurity challenge? Much of the corn (maize) harvest in the United States goes to alternative uses and so diverting it to food-insecure nations seems obvious. But that corn is not a variety suitable for human consumption. And what will then happen to livestock farmers or those working in the industries that require this raw input? The thinking that the world has and will have enough calories to feed everyone is a chimera: all harvested crops are not for the same use even when the crop is the same.

Alternately, we can increase crop production. This is continuously happening, but at what cost? In Brazil, mapped locations of loss of natural landscape appear to coincide with where crops are grown for the food processing industry. In Indonesia and Malaysia it appears to have been for the export market.

Organisations and governments are striving to increase yields (ostensibly of food crops) in food insecure countries. But the often-touted ‘yield-gap’ — the difference between the best performing countries and others, when factors such as climate and soils are taken into consideration — is somewhat misleading. American maize yields are several times those in Africa. But it is used for animal feed, processing and industrial usage versus food in Africa. When higher profit can be made from alternative uses, it will happen.

So in reality countries with food-insecure populations and with poverty will have to fend for themselves or import food crops. But how will that be even possible? Will they be able to compete in the open market? Or compete for donations? To grow food for food-insecure countries, will a farmer in Minnesota be forced to switch from corn to wheat? Will a wheat farmer in Western Australia or the UK be asked to try a new crop? Will a sugarcane farmer in India be forced to grow rice? These are tricky questions, but the development of high resolution maps showing the purpose of harvesting our lands and how it changed over time and its trajectory will help us manage multiple purposes: of reaching the second SDG; profitable agriculture for our farmers; supporting the middle class, and the agri-industry.

Fraction Used for Food

Otherwise, at current rates of yield improvements in food crops, 31 countries will likely not be able to sufficiently feed their population from within-country crop production by 2030. Another 17 countries will likely not be able to feed their expected extra population in 2030 from their within-country crop production.

We also do not know the lingering effects of Covid disruption, the war in Ukraine, regime change and conflicts in Afghanistan and elsewhere, and climate change on food security in 2030. The World Food Program estimates that currently 811 million people are hungry and the Food and Agriculture Organization projects that 670 million could be hungry in 2030.

The UN Sustainable Development Goals were agreed in September 2015 by 193 nations – the entire world. In 2022, we are nearly half way through to the goal year of 2030. Eight percent of the world population is predicted to be hungry in 2030, which is the same as when the SDGs were launched. Given the way things stand, without an extra effort in the 50 or so challenged nations, the world will together fail to end hunger. Elsewhere it is the relatively ‘simple’ matter of crop use and distribution.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Crop.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-non-food-crops-eating-up-our-food

Global warming and climate change has been a part of numerous discussions presided by world leaders over the past decades. It is a pressing problem and has almost become, unfortunately, a passé but still deserves our careful consideration. Human activities add to the lion’s share of CO2 emissions – with recent studies showing as much as 48 per cent increase in carbon dioxide since pre-industrial levels. The main culprits include deforestation, reliance on fossil fuels and farming livestock. One lesser-known victim of this global crisis is agriculture.

Impact of climate change on farming

Agriculture is extremely vulnerable to climate change and the numbers are not in its favour. To take India as a context, a study under the National Innovations in Climate-Resilient Agriculture (NICRA) projected that yields of rainfed and irrigated rice will reduce by <2.5 per cent and 7 per cent by 2050 respectively. Numbers for wheat and maize yields are projected to reduce by 6-25 per cent and 18-23 per cent by 2100 respectively. Additionally, small farms make up about 90 per cent of the total 570 million farms worldwide and are extremely sensitive to these climatic fluctuations.

Impact of climate change on horticulture

Horticulture is not spared from the implications of climate change either. Unpredictable high temperatures and rainfall patterns will have a big impact on the productivity of fruits and vegetables. For example, temperature increase can cause photosensitive crops to mature faster, pollination will be impacted significantly, flower and fruit drops will occur frequently, more water will be required for irrigation and the list goes on.

Fruits like grapes, citrus and melons which are photosensitive will mature earlier by about 15 days and high temperature plus moisture stress can cause apricot, cherries and apples to crack. Since India is the 2nd largest producer of fruits and vegetables in the world, our agrarian economy is at risk of collapsing if the issue of climate change isn’t addressed right now.

Why do we need climate-resilient agriculture?

Due to the prolonged threat of global warming, its impact will have far-reaching consequences that may not be apparent at present but can rear its head in the coming decades. Food security is one of them.

Food security is a global concern and one that is part of recent discussions in light of supply chain stress caused by the ongoing Russia-Ukraine conflict. But geopolitical issues aside, climatic issues will be a greater threat in the future and could lead to food insecurity. The scenario will lead to higher food prices but with lower output due to the unchecked heat waves impacting crop yields globally. The rising temperatures will also lead to increased stress on livestock which in turn will also affect the global food supply. The FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations) in 2015 projected that the global food demand could increase by more than 60 per cent by 2050, which will put further strain on the already climate-sensitive food supply chain.

Tech-driven countermeasure to enable climate-resilient agriculture

Climate change is happening and taking a proactive as well as a concerted effort is the only way to deal with this global phenomenon. A sustainable take on agricultural operations is one key approach to countering or mitigating the effects of climate change on our food supply.

When we talk about sustainability in farming, it is in relation to a more data-driven approach backed by science. Precision farming is an umbrella term which is built on this philosophy of using data collected via sensors, satellite imagery, artificial intelligence (AI), internet of things (IoT), drones, and automation among other sources to help make a more informed decision with farming operations. This can directly lead to higher quality and quantity of yields while reducing farm input costs and agriculture’s overall impact on the environment through lower usage of fertilisers and pesticides.

Precision farming tools

One of the key frameworks which enable precision farming at scale are the IoT sensors and other supporting tech like drones, GIS (Geographic Information System) and NDVI (Normalised Difference Vegetation Index) that help with gathering, measuring, analysing and storing real-time farm metrics. Thanks to IoT systems, farmers are able to produce better yields and as a byproduct, contribute to better food security and safety. The data-driven approach also allows room for better traceability within food production and farm management. The ability to monitor the entire supply chain leads to greater savings and larger profits for the farmers, making it a win-win situation for both the producers and the consumers.

Complementing precision farming are technologies like Variable-rate Technology (VRT) which allows for precise and controlled use of water, natural resources and farm inputs based on zone-specific deficiencies informed by farm-level data. This helps in minimising the wastage of precious resources and lowering the usage of fertilisers and pesticides leading to reduced emission of greenhouse gases and contamination of soil and water bodies.

Early disease prediction and local weather forecast also come with the territory of precision farming, empowering farmers to take preventive measures against climate change well in advance and further increasing their farming productivity and profitability.

Climate-resilient agriculture – A sustainable future

Climate change is not just our problem but everyone’s problem. We have the tech to make our food supply chain more resilient against potential threats like rising temperatures and erratic weather patterns brought by climate change.

Precision farming is already part of the agricultural ecosystem but just not at scale. Mass adoption will only come, especially in developing nations like India, if the tech is affordable and accessible to farmers with small land holdings. Many startups are already working on this issue by developing agritech solutions with both cost and form factors in mind. A local pool of experts and systematic knowledge transfer of these technologies via government initiatives and agri institutions are also key in educating the average luddite farmers. Government initiatives like the Indian Digital Ecosystem of Agriculture (IDEA) and AgriStack also serve as a great foundation for facilitating precision farming at scale and working towards combating climate change.

Major ISRO Centres, namely, National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad and Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad spearhead all such applications development and implementation initiatives from ISRO/DOS.","Satellite Communication Applications

A fleet of commercial communication satellites, are operating over India with communication transponders in C-band, Extended C-band, Ku-band and S-band. These transponders support the services like television, telecommunication, radio networking, strategic communication and societal applications. The prominent users of the transponders are BSNL, Doordarshan, All India Radio, strategic govt. users, public sector units, private VSAT operators, DTH and TV operators, banking and financial institutions, etc.

Under societal applications, ISRO/DOS has supported programmes like Telemedicine, Tele-education and Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programmes which are solely national development oriented with an aim to address specific requirements at different strata of the society.

Television

INSAT has been a major catalyst for the expansion of television coverage in India. DOS has made available the required transponders through INSAT/GSAT satellites and through leased capacity to cater to the needs of television service.

Radio Networking

Radio Networking (RN) through INSAT provides a reliable high-fidelity programme channels for National as well as Regional Networking. AIR is utilising one C-band transponder of INSAT-3C for uplinking RN carriers across the country.

Telecommunications

INSAT satellites have been traditionally supporting telecommunication applications for providing voice and data communications. Satellite links are the primary means of connectivity to remote and far flung regions of the country and they are the backup links for large number of terrestrial connectivity in the mainland.

Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs) networks are designed to support all kinds of applications supporting video, voice and data, with a wide range of data rates from few kilobits per second (kbps) to 8 megabits per seconds (mbps). A VSAT network comprises of a central hub and hundreds of terminals which are further interfaced to computers and other peripheral devices. The hub acts as a gateway with interface to external connectivity and several application servers. Rapid technological advancements and reduction in the cost of user equipment are increasing the popularity of VSAT network. A VSAT network works out to be a cheaper option while establishing a network to cover a wide geographical area, state wide or nationwide. VSAT networks operate in C, Extended C and Ku-bands.

Telemedicine

ISRO Telemedicine pilot project was started in the year 2001 as part of proof-of-concept demonstration programme, linking Apollo Hospital at Chennai with the Apollo Rural Hospital at Aragonda village in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. The Telemedicine technology involved the ICT based system consisting of customised medical software integrated with the computer hardware along with medical diagnostic instruments connected to the commercial VSAT at each location. The Telemedicine software consisted essentially of store-and-forward modules for Tele-radiology, Tele-cardiology and Tele-pathology purposes along with the video-conferencing facility.

As an on-going/continuous activity, tech support is provided to interested hospitals for conducting Continuing Medical Education (CME); operations of Hub are monitored and continuous follow-up is done with all users for optimum utilisation

Tele-education

‘EDUSAT’, India’s first thematic satellite dedicated exclusively for educational services, was used extensively to cater to a wide range of interactive educational delivery modes like one-way TV broadcast, video conferencing, computer conferencing, web-based instructions, etc. EDUSAT had manifold objectives - to supplement the curriculum-based teaching, imparting effective teacher training, providing access to quality resource persons and new technologies, thus finally resulting in taking education to every nook and corner of India. EDUSAT provided connectivity to schools, colleges and higher levels of education and also supported non-formal education including development communication.

EDUSAT Programme was implemented in three phases: pilot, semi-operational and operational phases. Pilot projects were conducted during 2004 in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh with 300 terminals. The experiences of pilot projects were adopted in semi-operational phase. During semi- operational phase, almost all the states and major national agencies were covered under EDUSAT programme.

The networks implemented under EDUSAT programme comprise of two types of terminals, namely, Satellite Interactive Terminals (SITs) and Receive Only Terminals (ROTs). Many states have expressed their keen interest to upgrade their networks and DOS is extending necessary technical assistance towards upgradation and expansion.

Satellite Meteorology

The meteorological satellite data of INSAT is processed and disseminated by INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) of India Meteorological Department (IMD) At present, INSAT/GSAT satellites carrying meteorological payloads are supporting weather forecasting services. IMDPS is capable to receive and process the data of all three existing geostationary meteorological satellites. The performance of the system has been maintained to the level of 98% operation efficiency (24x365 bases). The output generated by the system is used for efficient and successful forecasting the major weather events, particularly major cyclones in the past.

Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)

India is a member of the international COSPAS-SARSAT programme for providing distress alert and position location service through LEOSAR (Low Earth Orbit Search And Rescue) satellite system. Under this programme, India has established two Local User Terminals (LUTs), one at Lucknow and the other at Bengaluru. The Indian Mission Control Centre (INMCC) is located at ISTRAC, Bengaluru. The system is operational from the past 24 years.

Standard Time and Frequency Signal Dissemination Services

A Standard Time and Frequency Signal (STFS) Dissemination Service using INSAT system is provided by National Physical Laboratory. This service is available round-the-clock in a broadcast mode and is receivable on a set up consisting of receive antenna, a front-end converter, an FM demodulator and a microprocessor controlled signal decoder. The service consists of a train of 5 KHz bursts signal, which is frequency modulated on the carrier. The timing service has a precision of better than one microsecond and accuracy of better than 20 microseconds.

GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN)

The implementation of GAGAN has numerous benefits to the aviation sector in terms of fuel saving, saving in equipment cost, flight safety, increased air space capacity, efficiency, enhancement of reliability, reduction in workload for operators, coverage of oceanic area for air traffic control, high position accuracy, etc. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) certified GAGAN for enroute services (RNP 0.1) on the December 30, 2013 and further certified for precision approach (APV 1) on April 21, 2015. With this, GAGAN signal is available for both civil Aviation and Non-Aviation users. GAGAN Payloads are operational through GSAT-8, GSAT-10 and GSAT-15 satellites.

Some of the benefits GAGAN is expected to bring for Civil Aviation sector are:

Safety benefits – Vertical guidance improves safety, especially in adverse weather conditions

Reduction of circling approaches

Environmental benefits–Approach with Vertical Guidance procedures will help facilitate better energy and descent profile management during the final approach

Global seamless navigation for all phases of flight including arrival, departure, oceanic and en route

Allow direct routings, multiple approaches resulting in considerable fuel savings to airlines and provide for capacity enhancement of airports and airspace

In addition to aviation sector, GAGAN is expected to bring benefits to other sectors like:

Navigation and Safety Enhancement in Railways, Roadways, Ships, Spacecraft

Geographic Data Collection

Scientific Research for Atmospheric Studies

Geodynamics

Natural Resource and Land Management

Location based services, Mobile, Tourism, etc.

Some of the specific application initiatives are summarised below:

Surveying: (a) Karnataka forest department has used GAGAN dongle (a low end receiver devised to receive and process GAGAN) for forest surveys. (b) AAI is using GAGAN based surveys for airport survey requirements. (c) NRSC is using GAGAN for Ground Control Point Library recording.

Railways: NRSC, along with Indian Railways, are experimenting on various GAGAN based applications, particularly in providing unmanned level crossing warning to drivers using GAGAN – BHUVAN applications. NRSC is doing pilot work on Train tracking using GPS-GAGAN.

Monitoring of the status of Lhonak Lake in Sikkim and Pareechu Lake in Tibet was carried using CARTOSAT data and information was furnished to CWC. Earthquake: Pre- and post-disaster high-resolution satellite images (Cartosat-1/2, Resourcesat LISS IV) and 10 m DEM are used to map co-seismic landslides triggered during the earthquake. Many landslide-dammed lakes have also been mapped.

The processed data and information were sent to Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA), National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA) and National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), in addition to uploading to Bhuvan and NDEM web portals of ISRO. The information derived from satellite data is shared among various international agencies for unifying the efforts and coordinating rescue operations.

Early Warning Systems Development: Medium range flood forecast models were developed for the many river basins and operationally used in real-time in collaboration with Central Water Commission. Web-enabled spatial flood early warning system has been developed and being implemented in real-time during the monsoon periods.

An experimental early warning system for rainfall triggered landslides was developed and implemented along the pilgrimage route corridors leading to Gangotri, Badrinath and Kedarnath as well as along the Pithoragarh-Malpa route in Uttarakhand. The early warning is generated based on the statistical relation between the spatial (geological, morphological and terrain factors) and temporal (triggering factor; primarily long term rainfall events and the triggered landslides) controls of slope failure.

Space Applications Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad has developed a model for thunderstorm predictions. Further, a prediction model for heat waves was developed in 2015. Satellite derived information such as landuse/ land cover, vegetation cover, albedo, etc., are major influencing factors for the model. The experimental forecast output is overlaid on a GIS format with base data layers such as district boundaries, roads, railway lines, land use/land cover, etc. Both the forecasts were made available in MOSDAC and the links were given in Bhuvan and NDEM portals.

National Database for Emergency Management (NDEM): NDEM version 2.0 was launched with improved features and functions on ISRO satellite based Virtual Private Network (VPN). This portal consists of multi-scale geospatial database covering base, thematic, infrastructure, disaster specific products and satellite imagery along with a set of customised decision support tools. Generation of multi-scale geospatial services for 36 States / UTs at 1:50,000 scale, 209 out of 350 most vulnerable and multi hazard prone districts at 1:10,000 scale and high resolution satellite data for 210 towns has been completed. Satellite data derived value added disaster specific products (~209) covering 11 States covering disaster events in 2015 were hosted on NDEM portal. Mobile apps and user manuals were also uploaded in NDEM private and public portals for better utilisation of the services. Simultaneously, NDEM Public portal is hosted on ISRO Bhuvan platform through internet connectivity.

Seven regional training programmes for Central/State government departments (150 officers) have been organised across the country for the familiarisation of NDEM private and public portals for enabling the better utilisation of NDEM products and services.

Aerial survey for large-scale mapping: Close contour flood plain mapping is being carried out using airborne LiDAR / LFDC data for use in flood inundation modelling and flood depth assessment.

Satellite Aided Search and Rescue: The Satellite Aided Search and Rescue system which provides services to 7 neighbouring countries. Online Beacon registration system has been upgraded based on user requirements.

International cooperation in DMS: ISRO has carried out the Lead Role in International Charter Operations during April-October 2015. During this period, ISRO managed 17 activations, published three communications and Universal Access was extended to 5 countries. During 2015, satellite data support (28 scenes) were provided for 10 emergency requests from Vietnam, Pakistan, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Japan, Myanmar, Nepal and Taiwan for floods, oil spill, landslides and Typhoon disasters.

Remote Sensing Applications

Remote sensing application projects at National, State and Local levels are being carried out through well established multi-pronged implementation architecture of National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) in the country. Major ISRO Centres, namely, National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad and Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad spearhead all such applications development and implementation initiatives from ISRO/DOS. Regional Remote Sensing Centres (RRSCs) of NRSC, North-Eastern Space Application Centre (NE-SAC), Shillong and the State Remote Sensing Application Centres play a key role in implementation and reaching out to the grassroots for effective utilisation of the technology. User Ministries of State and Central Government departments and other institutions play a major role in utilising remote sensing technology in their own departments. In addition, private sector, Non-Governmental Organisations and academia also utilise this technology in different developmental sectors of the country.

National Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) mapping on 1:250,000: LU/LC assessment is made using semi-automated approach which includes automated processing of AWiFS quadrant data and classification using rule based approach. Water spread as well as snow cover information is generated though automated process. Rule based data integration of temporal datasets was adopted to derive final LU/LC output.

Crop Acreage and Production Estimation: The semi-physical spectral-spatial yield model was developed for various crops and provided to Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC) and required training is being imparted to MNCFC personnel for running the model and deriving planting date from time series NDVI data.

Coordinated programme on Horticulture Assessment and Management using Geoinformatics (CHAMAN): This national level project has been taken up, with the major objectives of (i) area assessment and production forecasting of major horticultural crops in selected districts in India; (ii) geospatial applications for horticultural development and management planning; and (iii) detailed scientific field level studies for developing technology for crop identification, yield modelling and disease assessment. Temporal high-resolution data (LISS-IV and Cartosat-1) has been used for delineation of spatial extent of the crop of interest. A mobile application ‘CHAMAN app’ was developed to aid in faster and efficient collection of ground information, as well as in building geodatabase through Bhuvan platform.

Cotton crop area mapping: Multi-temporal satellite (Landsat-8) data was classified and interpreted for cotton crop identification, discrimination and mapping for Wardha Taluka in Wardha district, Maharashtra. Land Use/Land Cover, forest, settlement, water bodies and ancillary data was used to mask the non-crop area. It was observed that around 17,900 ha area of study area was covered by cotton crop (21.4% of total geographical area). The results were subsequently validated in the field.

Indian Forest Cover Change Alert System (InFCCAS): A remote sensing based technique was developed for automated detection of forest cover loss of an area greater than 2 hectare for rapid annual monitoring. The forest pixels are identified on Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data (20 x 20 tiles) for Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal).

Study on Sundarban mangrove system: The mangrove ecosystem of Sundarbans region plays an important ecological and socio-economical role in both India and Bangladesh. The present study is aimed at analysing the impact of cyclone of varying intensity and at different period of phonological cycle on mangrove forests in Sundarbans region. MODIS time-series (2001-2011), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products were used to compute the MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI). In the present study, instantaneous disturbance caused by the super cyclones was analysed using MGDI approach. The combined impact of ‘SIDR’ and ‘Rashmi’ was successfully captured by the MGDI images of 2008. In case of ‘Aila’, the disturbed area was reasonably less in comparison to the areas with higher EVI changes (-50% to -30%). The spatial extent of disturbance in each island was mapped, which can further be integrated on a temporal scale to generate spatio- temporal severity map. This will help forest management to identify chronically disturbed areas, which may have potential for biological invasion.

Inventory and Monitoring of Glacial Lakes/Water Bodies: The project is being carried out at the behest of Central Water Commission. The inventory of glacial lakes and water bodies was carried out for the year 2009 using IRS satellite data and monitoring in the months from June to October was completed for last four years (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014). Similar activity for the year 2015 was taken up in June, 2015 for 477 glacial lakes and water bodies. Monthly monitoring reports are submitted.

Assessment of Irrigation Potential Utilisation (I.P.U) using geospatial data: The study has been initiated in April 2015 to assess Irrigation Potential Utilisation (I.P.U) under Major & Medium (M&M) irrigation projects in Krishna basin using the geo-spatial data. Temporal AWiFS data, canal network, project boundaries and LULC data available under various projects (India WRIS, SIS DP, NRC) are being utilised. The data bases such as basin, sub-basin boundaries, M&M projects, their canal network, river/ stream network and other base layers are being organised.

Re-assessment of basin scale water resources using Space inputs: ISRO and Central Water Commission (CWC) jointly executed demonstrative pilot studies in Godavari and Brahmani- Baitarani river basins wherein Space based geo-spatial inputs were used to estimate basin-level mean annual water resources. Ministry of Water Resources recommended upscaling the study to other river basins of the country by regional offices of CWC. CWC regional offices will carry out the study and NRSC will provide technical support and hand holding during the study execution.

Monitoring of Gas Pipelines of Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL): GAIL has about 15,000 line km gas pipeline network in India. GAIL and ISRO have undertaken a joint project for studying feasibility of remote sensing, as an alternative/ complement to the helicopter survey, for monitoring the Right of Usage (ROU) of the pipeline for any physical encroachments. A pilot study has been carried out for “Dahej-Vemar-Vijaipur” pipeline segment of about 610 line km. Results indicates that satellite remote sensing techniques (high resolution data) can be used to monitor the pipeline assets through periodic repeat coverage (say monthly) during the cloud-free season. A web application was also developed to demonstrate the usefulness and quick communication within the GAIL monitoring teams.

Island Information System (IIS): Department of Border Management, Ministry of Home Affairs constituted a Task force for holistic development of Islands in Maritime zones of India, with participation of all concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Agencies. Towards this, ISRO has prepared a geospatial inventory of all islands using satellite images and developed an Island Information System. A total of 1238 islands have been identified and reconciled by NRSC/ISRO, SOI, NHO and RGI. The Island Information System (IIS) has been shared with different ministries and departments.

Monitoring of Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) watersheds using geospatial technologies: Bhuvan – SRISHTI, a Web based GIS application (Geoportal), has been developed to enable monitoring and evaluation of IWMP watersheds, using satellite remote sensing and sample field data (collected using mobile application). This Geoportal would facilitate monitoring and evaluation of all IWMP watersheds for 10 states and 50 identified districts in 28 states. Bhuvan – DRISHTI, an android based interface tool, has been developed for field data capture of the development activities undertaken for the IWMP Projects and includes a facility to upload photos to Bhuvan IWMP Server.

Space-based Information Support for Decentralised Planning (SIS-DP): The project aims at providing web based spatial information comprising of ortho-rectified satellite image, thematic and field data, resource maps, cadastral maps, administrative boundaries, infrastructure layers, climate and socioeconomic data which will act as input for Decentralised Planning at Panchayat level. The project is being executed by respective State Remote Sensing Applications Centres (SRSAC) under the technical guidance and financial support from Overlay of cadastre maps over high resolution satellite image has been completed for 5 States (AP, Telangana, Haryana, Assam and Kerala) and 2 Districts of West Bengal; Bhuvan-Panchayats portal version - 2.0 and Mobile app for Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) asset data collection has been demonstrated for operational use. Training on decentralised planning and use of SIS-DP data for planning is being implemented with PRIs through Bhuvan Panchayat.

Snow and Glacier Studies: It is a joint initiative of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Department of Space. Retreat/advance for 73 glaciers spread over different parts of the Himalayan region were estimated using CORONA (1965) and LISS-III (2001) images. Snow cover Atlas of the Bhutan was completed.

Spatial modelling of fluoride contamination in ground water:

The spatial modeling has been for fluoride distribution in ground water using knowledge guided models, data driven models and the combination of both. Fluoride prediction maps generated using hybrid neuro-fuzzy integrated approach compared favourably among the four mathematical models used, namely, weighted overlay, fuzzy overlay, artificial neural network and hybrid neuro-fuzzy models for prediction of fluoride in ground water. Results were validated with field data.

Groundwater storage assessment coupling hydromorphology with lithology: The standard procedure of ground water resource estimation is based on the specific yield parameters of each rock type (lithology) derived through pumping test analysis. However, terrain conditions in the form of geomorphological variations have an important bearing on the net ground water recharge. An attempt was made to use both lithology and geomorphology as input variables to estimate the recharge from different sources in each lithology unit influenced by the geomorphic conditions (lith-geom) season wise separately.

Surface Energy Balance over Agro-ecosystems using Large Aperture Scintillometry: The unique advantage of Scintillometry is its ability to calculate areal averaged sensible heat fluxes over spatial distances comparable to those observed by satellites. The LAS system was set up in 2014 at the agricultural research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi. The LAS measures atmospheric turbulence and heat flux over path lengths between 250 m and 6000 m.

The LAS was augmented with an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) having sensors of net radiometer, pyranometer, anemometer (2 levels), humidity and temperature probes (2 heights) and a soil heat flux plate at 10 cm depth. The 5 min fluxes of net radiation (Rn), sensible heat (H), latent heat (LE) and soil heat (G) fluxes were averaged at hourly intervals. All the fluxes were integrated over the day to analyse their seasonal pattern. Using H and LE daily integrated fluxes, daily values of evaporative fraction, EF = LE/ (H+LE) are calculated and analysed for their seasonal pattern.

While the advantages of lower input costs in many natural farming systems are well documented, one common critique is that avoiding pesticides renders crops more vulnerable to pests. However, farmers following Akkadi Saalu view weeds favourably and pests with tolerance, instead of trying to destroy them.

Multicropping gives farmers with smaller landholdings more security. There is less risk of losing all crops at once at a time of multiple intersecting risks, from erratic weather and degrading soils to unpredictable markets.

Prabhakar B. is a traditional farmer from Nangali village in Karnataka’s Kolar district. Along with P. Srinivas, popularly known as ‘Soil Vasu’, he leases degraded rainfed plots and converts them to biodiverse agroecological farms.

Prabhakar’s mother, Rajamma, also swears by the traditional farming practices and seed varieties passed on by their ancestors. “When I got married, my parents passed on these seeds to me, they told me to take care of them and that one day, the seeds will take care of my family,” said Rajamma. She said that they preserve their seeds with a great deal of care and do not use them during particularly harsh summers when drought-like conditions prevail over this semi-arid belt in Kolar. Rajamma considers a farm “an equal resource to all forms of life including pests and insects”.

The farm follows a traditional intercropping system followed in Karnataka called Akkadi Saalu, which encourages biodiversity on the farm and secures the yield from the farmland. It is traditionally practised on rainfed agricultural land as dryland agriculture. Akkadi Saalu is all about growing diversified crops – a mix of millets, oil seeds, pulses and other medicinal herbs along with greens and flower plants.

Large parts of agricultural land in Karnataka is undergoing degradation, affecting crop yield and farmers’ incomes. There is an urgent need to look beyond high-input monocropping systems and towards agroecological systems such as Akkadi Saalu, especially for small or marginal farmers whose precarious rainfed agricultural livelihoods are vulnerable to extreme weather events and pest attacks.

But what does Akkadi Saalu entail? How have Prabhakar and Vasu been able to keep his biodiverse farm thriving in a semi-arid landscape through this method? Based on our interviews and observations, we have documented the practices that they follow.

Creating farms that provide food, nutrition and fodder security

Akkadi Saalu was promoted keeping in mind that the crops may grow for two agricultural seasons – monsoon (kharif) and winter (rabi). This type of farming involves working with the land, the soil and the seasons. A variety of seeds are sown just before the first pre-monsoon rains. A couple of weeks after these germinate, the soil is turned over. This increases the organic matter in the soil but also ensures that the seeds of most weeds have germinated and been eliminated.

In the monsoon season, multiple crops are grown. The primary crop is intercropped with crops that have different growing periods ranging from 3 to 6 months. While the primary crop is grown for sale in the market, the intercrops and weeds are intended for home consumption. The inter-crops include crops like pigeon peas, millets, and oilseeds. Both hybrid and native seeds are used. The intercropping plants are usually placed in the periphery of each plot.

After the kharif harvest, the soil is turned over and the crop residue is mulched and the field is sown again with four or five types of seeds. The rabi crop is almost exclusively meant for fodder, for cattle. Generally, the hay produced on one acre is sufficient to tide three to four cattle over the hot summer season. One of the primary characteristics of the Akkadi Saalu method is the equal focus on food and fodder. The diversity of harvest timings ensure that benefits accrue at different times. The field is covered with crops for almost 8 months of the year relying entirely on soil moisture with no supplementary irrigation.

The discarded crop residue is used as manure for the main crops grown in the next season. The constant mulching ensures that all soil organic matter is conserved and soil is nutrient rich.

Focusing on soil health and moisture rather than irrigation

In the Akkadi Saalu method, earthworms and other soil organisms are used to create preferential pathways. The central principle of the method is that if soil biodiversity is conserved then the soil fauna will dig tunnels and burrows and create preferential pathways for the rainwater to infiltrate. Engineering studies investigating infiltration into soils tend to underestimate the role of biodiversity in determining soil infiltration characteristics. One of the critical aspects of Akkadi Saalu is therefore to preserve life in the soil and not use pesticides.

Additionally, differential root depths create pathways in soil in this method. The use of multiple plants for intercropping is not just for nutrition but also to boost nutrients (nitrogen fixation), soil carbon and soil moisture. The plants are specifically chosen for their diversity in rooting systems. Some have a single deep tap root, others have lateral roots and so on. Each of these root systems aids in filtration and spreading of soil moisture.

One of the common species used in intercropping is castor. Castor is an annual crop with large leaves, which grows to a height of about 6 ft by the summer. Leaving castor in the field over the summer months reduces bare soil evaporation and further conserves soil moisture. It is mulched again before the next kharif crop and the cycle begins again.

Because of the emphasis on high soil organic carbon and moisture, farms that follow Akkadi Saalu need very little ploughing. Farmers argue that the soil organisms act as tractors, keeping it porous and constantly turning the soil over.

Treating weeds as wealth and living with pests

While the advantages of lower input costs in many natural farming systems (including Akkadi Saalu) are well documented, one common critique is that avoiding pesticides renders crops more vulnerable to pests. Here, there is a fundamental philosophical difference: farmers following Akkadi Saalu view weeds favourably and pests with tolerance, instead of trying to destroy them.

American biologist Rachel Carson famously wrote in her seminal book, Silent Spring, 60 years ago, “One natural check is a limit on the amount of suitable habitat for each species. Obviously then, an insect that lives on a wheat farm can build its population to much higher levels on a farm devoted to wheat than on one in which wheat is intermingled with other crops to which the insect is not adapted.”

One of the striking characteristics of farmers who practise Akkadi Saalu throughout Karnataka, is the recognition that weeds provide direct and indirect benefits. Many rural farmers are able to recognise the medicinal benefits of weeds, which are used in soppu saru (green stew) and as fodder for their cattle. It’s common to see the weeds being taken home for dinner.

Resilience to pests is one of the much-touted benefits of a diversified farm. One of the key features of Akkadi Saalu is the use of ‘trap crops’. These crops are deliberately chosen to attract unwanted pests. The pests feed on trap crops and leave the main crops alone. Typical trap crops are oilseeds like castor. If there are enough trap crops, pests are able to complete their entire lifecycle on the crop. Other plants are bird attractors. The birds come and eat pests and the grain/fruit on the bird attractor plants leaving the main crop alone.

The principle of ‘leaving some for nature’ and using biocontrols is dramatically different from the conventional approach of killing pests. In the Indian context of small farm sizes, it may be effective, especially in the context of rainfed agriculture when farmers have to keep input costs under control.

Making a decent living off a single acre of rainfed land

The most important feature is that Akkadi Saalu may be more economically viable and less risky, than conventional agriculture, particularly in small rainfed plots. The key to the economic viability is that every single component of the groundnut is used and the farmer gets the benefit of the value addition, only paying a nominal processing fee for rental of the equipment.

For example, an acre of land yields about 700 kg of groundnut, which yields 230 litres of oil. Each litre will sell for around Rs. 400. Also the processed groundnut oil cake would be around 450 kg and it will sell for Rs. 50 per kg. So, if processing is considered inhouse, then total earnings would be approximately Rs. 1.12 lakhs (Rs. 112,000). This might not seem like much, but it is almost thrice what conventional ragi farmers make per acre.

Similar agroecological practices are followed across India

This form of intercropping is not unique to south-eastern Karnataka; Akkadi Saalu is the local name here. Similar traditional practices are still widely practised by farmers, who own small or marginal land holdings, across the country today. For example, Navadhanya in Andhra Pradesh. Mainly followed in the Rayalaseema regions of Anantapur and Chittoor, this poly-crop system caters to commercial markets through a ‘main crop’ and provides for domestic consumption by cultivating several varieties of pulses, oil seeds, vegetables and cereals. Traditional farmers in Andhra Pradesh and parts of Telangana also use the name Pannendu Pantalu to refer to cultivation of 12 different food grains on one plot of land.

The Himalayan states, including Uttarakhand, also follow a similar practice but they call it Barah Anaaj. The 12 crops that typically make up their method include ragi (millets), amaranthus, kidney bean, green gram, buck wheat, lobia (black eyed pea), horse gram and a few other crops.

In parts of Tamil Nadu, farmers who practise intercropping call it Oodu Payir. They mainly grow a combination of ragi, groundnut, horse gram, sesame along with field beans (Avare), cowpea, toor dal, black gram. Hangadi Kheti in Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh; Kurwa in Jharkhand; Baradhanya in Maharashtra all refer to traditional forms of intercropping. This reflects the diversity of such practices that exist all across India, as smallholder farmers adopt unique cultivation methods and crop choices based on the soil and climatic conditions of where they are based. But some of the principles of preserving soil health, and managing weeds and pests remain the same.

Multicropping gives farmers with smaller landholdings more security. There is less risk of losing all crops at once at a time of multiple intersecting risks, from erratic weather and degrading soils to unpredictable markets. Rachel Carson had also written, “Nature has introduced great variety into the landscape, but man has displayed a passion for simplifying it.” Prabhakar’s 1.06-acre Akkadi Saalu plot is an example of what retaining ‘great variety’ looks like.

Being the youngest agricultural research institution in the country, PJTSAU is striving hard to develop high-yielding varieties in different crops for the benefit of Telangana farmers through focussed research, extension and keeping in view of the farmers' needs.

According to the university's report, PJTSAU has released 46 high-yielding varieties through earlier Central Varietal Research Committee (CVRC) and State Varietal Research Committee (SVRC) meetings on different crops following the formation of the Telangana state. Subsequently, the varieties viz., Telanagana Sona, KNM 1638, KNM 118, JGL 24423, Bathukamma, WGL 962 in rice, Karimnagar Makka-1 in Maize, PRG-176 and WRGE 97 in Red Gram and WGG 42, MGG 385 in Green Gram have become popular in Telangana and adjoining states.

During the year 2022, almost eight new varieties have been developed by PJTSAU, in three crops that include five in rice, two in fodder Bajra and one in sesame, which were approved and released through CVRC for cultivation in different states and was even published in the Indian Gazette.

However, at the State level, another seven varieties of three crops viz., five in rice, one each in Black Gram and Sesame were recommended for release through an SVRC meeting held on September 3, 2022 under the chairmanship of State Agriculture Department secretary and Agricultural Production Commisioner (APC) M Raghunanadan Rao.

Accordingly, the same proposals were reviewed by the CVRC committee on October 26, 2022 at New Delhi and identified it as promising and approved for its release for the state of Telangana. Among them, five in rice, one each in Black Gram and sesame were submitted for approval by the 4th State Sub-Committee on Crop Standards and Release of Varieties during the meeting held on September 3, 2022. After examining the proposals on an entry wise basis, all these seven cultures were accepted for release by the SVRC.

High head rice recovery, biotic and saline resistancy and super fine grain with good cooking qualities are some of the important traits that signify these newly released varieties.

With the help of mobile apps, IoT gadgets, AI, and tech-enabled devices, ReshaMandi is empowering farmers to raise production, lower wastage, improve quality, and, thereby, increase farmers’ income. Mayank Tiwari, Co-founder & CEO, ReshaMandi speaks to Agriculture Post on how his technological interventions are bringing a silent revolution in the sericulture value chain…

Excerpts:

What difference is ReshaMandi making in the sericulture sector and how does it impact the lives of farmers?

ReshaMandi is India’s first and largest digital ecosystem for the natural fibre supply chain, connecting farms to fashion. At ReshaMandi, we are determined to standardise the industry, starting from the grassroots, such as farmers, reelers, weavers, retailers, and finally, consumers. We are digitising the supply chain of natural fibres and eradicating hurdles faced by stakeholders across the chain.

We are offering insights to stakeholders in the natural fibre supply chain. These include weather and soil quality updates and how they could impact cocoons, market linkages of input procurement (cocoon) and selling output (yarns), maintaining ledgers, information on best practices and purchasing machine tools. ReshaMandi’s innovative technique is revolutionising natural fibre farming in India. We are successfully using the Internet of Things (IoT) to boost agricultural productivity. Since most farmers lack tech skills, any technology should be extremely easy for all parties to use.

ReshaMandi’s technological intervention and people-first approach have helped farmers improve their productivity by 20 per cent and boost incomes by nearly 30 per cent, enabling them to afford better quality raw materials, high-quality labour, fertilisers, and other essential inputs, which are pushing yields higher.

You’re creating a tech-enabled value chain for silk, how is it different from the conventional value chain?

India is the second-largest producer of raw silk in the world. Notwithstanding that, the industry still faces many hurdles such as volatile yields, price fluctuations of cocoons, and arbitrary testing methods by silk reelers. Issues such as lack of standardisation, poor database management, and a diverse range of practices leading to fluctuations in production and quality are still plaguing the sector. As we work at the grassroots levels, we have been able to gauge the needs of stakeholders to address the same. We have effectively integrated technology into the supply chain, ensuring all stakeholders reap the benefits.

We provide IoT devices for measuring soil pH and moisture content, sunlight, air quality, humidity, and temperature. With the help of mobile apps, IoT gadgets, AI, and tech-enabled devices, ReshaMandi is empowering farmers to raise production, lower wastage, improve quality, and, thereby, increase their income. Our IoT devices assist silk farmers in analysing the silkworm-rearing process and identifying the best irrigation practices for higher yields of mulberry plants that are the main feed for worms

ReshaMandi has a network of 23 procurement centres where farmers can get in touch with representatives, either through a phone call or by visiting the centre in person with a prior appointment. Farmers have the option to pick up inputs directly or order through the app with the representative’s help. We have the flexibility to book an appointment with them to collect the cocoons from the farmer’s house to avoid a long journey to the mandis.

What technologies do you apply in creating this supply chain?

We have been incorporating several technologies such as machine learning, AI, data analytics, and IoT, to name a few. The result is the ReshaMandi super-app – one app that can be used by stakeholders across the supply chain. We recently released a new IoT device, which has been researched, developed, and engineered by ReshaMandi to improve the previous version of our IoT device for farmers. Last month, we launched the ReshaMandi App for iOS devices and stakeholders using iOS devices have begun using this app. Previously it was available only on an android platform.

Kindly describe the silk economy in India with factors like production, exports, number of farmers associated with silk cultivation, challenges in market linkages, innovations coming in, and geographical distribution.

India is the second-largest producer and largest consumer of silk with a production value amounting to 34000 MT. The market for raw silk was valued at US$2.5 billion in FY22, whereas consumption volume stood at 40,000 MT. The southern zone (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala) accounts for 59 per cent of the total silk production. According to IBEF, The most exported silk items from India remain silk fabrics and garments, with export shares of 45.3 per cent and 36.3 per cent in 2021-22, respectively. Silk waste (11.3 per cent), silk carpets (4.3 per cent), and natural silk yarn (2.8 per cent) make up most of India’s overall silk exports.

The silk industry is highly unorganised with problems such as price fluctuations, absence of proper markets, lack of proper logistics, no definitive advisory, minimal quality testing, and no transparency in the processes. This being a buyers’ market, farmers are often subjected to cartel practices to drive down prices. We aim to eliminate uncertainties in the ecosystem, presenting a completely transparent process to farmers.

What challenges do you face while your operations with the farmers and how do you tackle them?

The first few days were extremely challenging. We had to educate the farmers as well as all our other stakeholders about our platform and the value it offers, including the advancement that ReshaMandi brings. Once we convinced a handful of people, it was just a matter of networking within stakeholder communities. Today, through our super app, we have successfully enabled 100 per cent of farmers on the platform to transact digitally. Most often, under the guise of low product quality, stakeholders in this ecosystem are exploited and underpaid. This is mostly because they don’t grasp the value of their produce in the market. By educating them about the latest tech solutions, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we are striving to eliminate such issues. Since our inception, tech innovations have revolutionised the country’s natural fibre supply chain, greatly enhancing the ability to control this unorganised sector.

Kindly tell us a few success stories on your interventions transforming the farmer value chain.

One such case concerns Gurumallesh, a BA graduate and a rare example of a well-educated young person choosing to forego city life to pursue a successful career in sericulture. He started on a small piece of land. Today, he owns a nice house, a 4.5-acre farm, and two silkworm-rearing houses. He now cultivates only silk and boasts 150 kg of produce every month.

ReshaMandi’s technology intervention helped Gurumallesh and farmers like him get higher margins and enabled them to afford better quality raw materials, higher quality labour, fertilisers, and other essential inputs, which in turn are pushing yields even higher.

Do you have any plans to diversify your portfolio? If yes, kindly elucidate.

In early 2020, we began the journey with silk. In FY22, however, we added other natural fibres such as cotton, coir, jute, and banana to the portfolio, managing the entire ecosystem for all natural fibres catering to a diverse set of stakeholders.

The growing population is imposing a big pressure on natural resources. Do you also advocate sustainable practices among the farmers associated with you?

Since the beginning of our journey, we have been a proponent of sustainable fashion. We have been collaborating closely with farmers to recycle silk and cocoon wastes (produced by farmlands and reeling units, respectively), which are now being used to extract sericin – a silk protein that is used in the pharmaceutical and packaging industries. Pupae (a by-product of reeling operations) can be used for fish and poultry feeding. Earlier farmers would burn mulberry twigs as they did not know how crucial these are as raw materials in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and FMCG industries. We are working closely with farmers to recycle agricultural waste in other businesses.

What markets do you cater to for exporting the commodities you are operating in?

We now have global footprints and plans to become a one-stop natural and recycled fibres sourcing platform in various countries including the Middle East, Europe, North and South America, and South East Asia (SEA) to replicate its successful India model. We have already entered MENA and SEA regions as both these markets are rapidly emerging and are the world’s fastest-growing apparel and textile hubs.

In what geographical areas do you operate and how many farmers benefit from your solutions?

Besides our 23 procurement centres and 4 cocoon sales centres across India, we run 25 mandis (big markets) across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. We are present in four weaving clusters in some of India’s silk capitals – Varanasi, Dharmavaram, Salem, and Kanchipuram. We began working with the farmers in Sarjapura, Karnataka, and today we have expanded our operations to almost 5,000 pin codes across India. We also aim to increase our retail footprint further into Agra, Kota, Gorakhpur, Dhanbad, Ranchi, Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Rajkot, Vadodara, Surat, Pune, Nagpur, Satara, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Madurai, Coimbatore, Kochi, and Kannur. Currently, we are working with over 60,000 farmers.

What strategies do you apply to reach the farming community to increase their association with ReshaMandi?

Our business approach has had a substantial impact on farmers’ productivity and revenue. Being a closed community, word-of-mouth has helped us win the trust of farmers. Continuous efforts and development for the betterment of stakeholders is our only approach to maintaining an association with them. Our executives are constantly engaging in periodic activities for farmers, organising sessions to enlighten them on the benefits of technology and the empowerment we can bring to them.

What new offerings are you going to bring in the future?

We have announced our new venture ReshaMudra, which will give business partners across the ecosystem access to working capital solutions as well as long-term loans, enabling them to secure crucial funding to help grow their businesses or tide over challenging times. As mentioned earlier we have launched a unique programme called ReshaAbhivrudi which will resolve problems related to crop yields, crop loss, lack of advisories, and more.

Moreover, we have introduced an industry-first, trend forecast report that will predict fashion trends and shape the industry over a year. The report will share market intelligence and map consumer behaviour, allowing designers, exporters, and retailers to better plan inventory and manage operations well. We have already entered the global markets via Southeast Asia and the Middle East and plan to become a one-stop sourcing solution for natural fibres globally.

“Millets have a glorious history of being among the earliest crops grown by humans,” Modi stated in his address to the opening ceremony of the ""International Year of Millets 2023,"" which was held at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome, Italy. In the past, they were an important source of food. However, the urgent requirement is to provide them with a food option for the future.



Modi said, “A global movement related to millets is an important step since they are easy to grow, climate resilient, and drought resistant.”

Millet production in India

Jowar (sorghum), bajra (pearl millet), and ragi (finger millet) are the three main millet crops that are currently being grown in India. India also produces a wide variety of indigenous, biogenetically diverse ""small millets"" like kodo, kutki, chenna, and sanwa. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Haryana. are the major producers of millet in the country.

BCCL/Representational Image

According to a PIB report, the production of millets has increased from 14.52 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 17.96 million tonnes in 2020-21.

Millets can be grown in mountainous, low-fertility, dry, rain-fed, and tribal areas. It requires less labor-intensive cultivation, has shorter cultivation cycles, and is beneficial to the soil. Millets can be a long-term source of income for farmers due to low investment requirements.

Significance of millets

PM Modi said millets benefit consumers, farmers, and the environment. They are a good source of a healthy diet; they benefit the cultivators and the climate since they need lesser water and are viable with regular approaches to cultivating.

“There is a need for diversity on the land and on our tables. If agriculture becomes monoculture, it impacts our health and the health of our lands. Millets are a good way to increase agricultural and dietary diversity,” he added.

BCCL/Representational Image

Millets are a sustainable food source for combating hunger in a changing global climate because they are resistant to climatic stress, pests, and diseases. Further, millets do not require a lot of water or other resources, making them a long-term option for combating climate change and constructing climate-resilient agri-food systems.

Nutri-cereals are a powerhouse of nutrients, including iron, folate, calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, vitamins, and antioxidants. Millets are high in dietary fiber. They have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes in adults, in addition to being crucial for children's healthy growth and development.

Millets, which are free of gluten and have a low glycemic index, are beneficial to diabetics and can assist in preventing cardiovascular disease and nutritional deficiency.

Initiatives by the government to promote millet

The government increased the MSP of millets, providing farmers with a significant price incentive. The government has included millets in the public distribution system to ensure a steady market for the produce.

BCCL/Representational Image

The government has made seed kits and other inputs available to farmers helped build value chains through Farmer Producer Organizations and made millets more marketable.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been establishing Nutri-gardens, promoting research on the connections between crop diversity and dietary diversity, and running a behaviour change campaign to increase consumer demand for Nutri-cereals.

BRS launch:Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao renamed his party, TRS, as the Bharat Rashtra Samithi

A one-line resolution to rename the party was passed at the TRS general body meeting after over 230 delegates signed it.

Rao, popularly known as KCR, who has been rallying regional parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the national elections, read out the resolution announcing the new name at 1.19 pm, considered to be auspicious.

Amid thumping of desks, claps and cheers by party delegates, KCR said the party’s constitution has been amended to rename the TRS as BRS. Party workers, who gathered outside the Telangana Bhavan in large numbers, burst crackers and raised “Desh Ka Neta KCR” slogans.

In a brief speech, KCR explained the reasons for the transition. He said the purpose for which the TRS was floated in April 2001 was achieved with the formation of the state of Telangana and making it the number one state in the country on all fronts in the last eight years.

“Now, it is time to take the Telangana model of development to the entire country. Even after 75 years of independence, India has remained backward in many areas, lagging behind smaller countries such as Bangladesh. The country has not been able to harness the full potential in agriculture and irrigation,” he regretted.

The chief minister said that the BRS will take a lead role in providing an alternative development model for the country, and will make all-out efforts to put India on the global map of developed nations.

KCR has been meeting chiefs of regional parties over the last year as part of his efforts to unite them for a third political alternative against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Congress. In Telangana, KCR’s party has been on a collision course with the BJP and called for a BJP-mukt Bharat, accusing it of fanning communalism and practising divisive politics.

Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, president of Viduthalai Chirutagal Katchi (VMK) and Chidambaram MP Tholkappiyan Thirumavalavan and some farm leaders were among those present at the occasion.

TRS leaders had earlier indicated KCR may announce the launch of the new party and merge the TRS into it. But the plan was tweaked and a decision was taken to rename the party to be able to retain its flag, election symbol, and organisational structure.

A party leader said KCR will be elected as BRS national president and that he will also name a Telangana unit chief.

Soon after the meeting, senior TRS leader and former MP B Vinod Kumar and other senior leaders left for New Delhi with a letter addressed to the Election Commission of India, communicating the change of the party’s name.

KCR last month announced free electricity for farmers across the country if a BRS-led front is voted to power in the 2024 election and accused the Centre of pressuring the states to end welfare schemes on the pretext that they were freebies.

In August, KCR met Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and backed the Janata Dal-United leader’s call for a united opposition ahead of the 2024 elections. It was the latest in his series of such meetings as part of efforts to build an alternative alliance.

KCR visited Bihar days after Nitish Kumar’s ended his alliance with the BJP for a second time to align with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and Left parties.

Bhupender Sigh Mann along Sugunakar Rao inaugurated the mela here on Thursday. Speaking on the occasion, Mann congratulated Sugunakar Rao for organising Kisan Grameen Mela on a large scale for the first time in Telangana.

He said that by arranging such melas for the farmers, there would be an opportunity to increase their income. Farmers were advised to take advantage of the Kisan Grameen Mela.

Sugunakar Rao said that for increasing the means of income of farmers the Kisan Mela was organised. In other countries, 80 quintals of rice was grown per acre, but in India farmers grow 25 quintals alone.

He said that development of farmers would happen only with rural development. The mela was organised to make agriculture cost-effective and profitable and to help farmers to know the new agriculture methods.

Recently, corporate job holders quitting jobs to do agriculture, so farmers should think and try to make agriculture profitable. Kisan Grameen Mela was an attempt to achieve economic development in the agricultural sector as much as in other sectors.

On Thursday awareness was given to the farmers on crops and marketing, on November 4 dairy, poultry, fishermen, sheep breeders, weaving, and on November 5 women's association products, marketing and vegetable farmers would be made aware.

Later, agronomist Jagapathi Rao said that the State government's crop plan was flawed. He said that by planting paddy and cotton crops in Telangana, there would be bad consequences along with climate change. Cultivation of other crops was very necessary.

These transponders support the services like television, telecommunication, radio networking, strategic communication and societal applications. The prominent users of the transponders are BSNL, Doordarshan, All India Radio, strategic govt. users, public sector units, private VSAT operators, DTH and TV operators, banking and financial institutions, etc.

Under societal applications, ISRO/DOS has supported programmes like Telemedicine, Tele-education and Disaster Management Support (DMS) Programmes which are solely national development oriented with an aim to address specific requirements at different strata of the society.

Television

INSAT has been a major catalyst for the expansion of television coverage in India. DOS has made available the required transponders through INSAT/GSAT satellites and through leased capacity to cater to the needs of television service.

Radio Networking

Radio Networking (RN) through INSAT provides a reliable high-fidelity programme channels for National as well as Regional Networking. AIR is utilising one C-band transponder of INSAT-3C for uplinking RN carriers across the country.

Telecommunications

INSAT satellites have been traditionally supporting telecommunication applications for providing voice and data communications. Satellite links are the primary means of connectivity to remote and far flung regions of the country and they are the backup links for large number of terrestrial connectivity in the mainland.

Very Small Aperture Terminals (VSATs) networks are designed to support all kinds of applications supporting video, voice and data, with a wide range of data rates from few kilobits per second (kbps) to 8 megabits per seconds (mbps). A VSAT network comprises of a central hub and hundreds of terminals which are further interfaced to computers and other peripheral devices. The hub acts as a gateway with interface to external connectivity and several application servers. Rapid technological advancements and reduction in the cost of user equipment are increasing the popularity of VSAT network. A VSAT network works out to be a cheaper option while establishing a network to cover a wide geographical area, state wide or nationwide. VSAT networks operate in C, Extended C and Ku-bands.

Telemedicine

ISRO Telemedicine pilot project was started in the year 2001 as part of proof-of-concept demonstration programme, linking Apollo Hospital at Chennai with the Apollo Rural Hospital at Aragonda village in the Chittoor district of Andhra Pradesh. The Telemedicine technology involved the ICT based system consisting of customised medical software integrated with the computer hardware along with medical diagnostic instruments connected to the commercial VSAT at each location. The Telemedicine software consisted essentially of store-and-forward modules for Tele-radiology, Tele-cardiology and Tele-pathology purposes along with the video-conferencing facility.

As an on-going/continuous activity, tech support is provided to interested hospitals for conducting Continuing Medical Education (CME); operations of Hub are monitored and continuous follow-up is done with all users for optimum utilisation

Tele-education

‘EDUSAT’, India’s first thematic satellite dedicated exclusively for educational services, was used extensively to cater to a wide range of interactive educational delivery modes like one-way TV broadcast, video conferencing, computer conferencing, web-based instructions, etc. EDUSAT had manifold objectives - to supplement the curriculum-based teaching, imparting effective teacher training, providing access to quality resource persons and new technologies, thus finally resulting in taking education to every nook and corner of India. EDUSAT provided connectivity to schools, colleges and higher levels of education and also supported non-formal education including development communication.

EDUSAT Programme was implemented in three phases: pilot, semi-operational and operational phases. Pilot projects were conducted during 2004 in Karnataka, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh with 300 terminals. The experiences of pilot projects were adopted in semi-operational phase. During semi- operational phase, almost all the states and major national agencies were covered under EDUSAT programme.

The networks implemented under EDUSAT programme comprise of two types of terminals, namely, Satellite Interactive Terminals (SITs) and Receive Only Terminals (ROTs). Many states have expressed their keen interest to upgrade their networks and DOS is extending necessary technical assistance towards upgradation and expansion.

Satellite Meteorology

The meteorological satellite data of INSAT is processed and disseminated by INSAT Meteorological Data Processing System (IMDPS) of India Meteorological Department (IMD) At present, INSAT/GSAT satellites carrying meteorological payloads are supporting weather forecasting services. IMDPS is capable to receive and process the data of all three existing geostationary meteorological satellites. The performance of the system has been maintained to the level of 98% operation efficiency (24x365 bases). The output generated by the system is used for efficient and successful forecasting the major weather events, particularly major cyclones in the past.

Satellite Aided Search and Rescue (SAS&R)

India is a member of the international COSPAS-SARSAT programme for providing distress alert and position location service through LEOSAR (Low Earth Orbit Search And Rescue) satellite system. Under this programme, India has established two Local User Terminals (LUTs), one at Lucknow and the other at Bengaluru. The Indian Mission Control Centre (INMCC) is located at ISTRAC, Bengaluru. The system is operational from the past 24 years.

Standard Time and Frequency Signal Dissemination Services

A Standard Time and Frequency Signal (STFS) Dissemination Service using INSAT system is provided by National Physical Laboratory. This service is available round-the-clock in a broadcast mode and is receivable on a set up consisting of receive antenna, a front-end converter, an FM demodulator and a microprocessor controlled signal decoder. The service consists of a train of 5 KHz bursts signal, which is frequency modulated on the carrier. The timing service has a precision of better than one microsecond and accuracy of better than 20 microseconds.

GPS Aided Geo Augmented Navigation (GAGAN)

The implementation of GAGAN has numerous benefits to the aviation sector in terms of fuel saving, saving in equipment cost, flight safety, increased air space capacity, efficiency, enhancement of reliability, reduction in workload for operators, coverage of oceanic area for air traffic control, high position accuracy, etc. Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) certified GAGAN for enroute services (RNP 0.1) on the December 30, 2013 and further certified for precision approach (APV 1) on April 21, 2015. With this, GAGAN signal is available for both civil Aviation and Non-Aviation users. GAGAN Payloads are operational through GSAT-8, GSAT-10 and GSAT-15 satellites.

Some of the benefits GAGAN is expected to bring for Civil Aviation sector are:

Remote Sensing Applications

Remote sensing application projects at National, State and Local levels are being carried out through well established multi-pronged implementation architecture of National Natural Resources Management System (NNRMS) in the country. Major ISRO Centres, namely, National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad and Space Application Centre (SAC), Ahmedabad spearhead all such applications development and implementation initiatives from ISRO/DOS. Regional Remote Sensing Centres (RRSCs) of NRSC, North-Eastern Space Application Centre (NE-SAC), Shillong and the State Remote Sensing Application Centres play a key role in implementation and reaching out to the grassroots for effective utilisation of the technology. User Ministries of State and Central Government departments and other institutions play a major role in utilising remote sensing technology in their own departments. In addition, private sector, Non-Governmental Organisations and academia also utilise this technology in different developmental sectors of the country.

National Land Use/Land Cover (LU/LC) mapping on 1:250,000: LU/LC assessment is made using semi-automated approach which includes automated processing of AWiFS quadrant data and classification using rule based approach. Water spread as well as snow cover information is generated though automated process. Rule based data integration of temporal datasets was adopted to derive final LU/LC output.

Crop Acreage and Production Estimation: The semi-physical spectral-spatial yield model was developed for various crops and provided to Mahalanobis National Crop Forecasting Centre (MNCFC) and required training is being imparted to MNCFC personnel for running the model and deriving planting date from time series NDVI data.

Coordinated programme on Horticulture Assessment and Management using Geoinformatics (CHAMAN): This national level project has been taken up, with the major objectives of (i) area assessment and production forecasting of major horticultural crops in selected districts in India; (ii) geospatial applications for horticultural development and management planning; and (iii) detailed scientific field level studies for developing technology for crop identification, yield modelling and disease assessment. Temporal high-resolution data (LISS-IV and Cartosat-1) has been used for delineation of spatial extent of the crop of interest. A mobile application ‘CHAMAN app’ was developed to aid in faster and efficient collection of ground information, as well as in building geodatabase through Bhuvan platform.

Cotton crop area mapping: Multi-temporal satellite (Landsat-8) data was classified and interpreted for cotton crop identification, discrimination and mapping for Wardha Taluka in Wardha district, Maharashtra. Land Use/Land Cover, forest, settlement, water bodies and ancillary data was used to mask the non-crop area. It was observed that around 17,900 ha area of study area was covered by cotton crop (21.4% of total geographical area). The results were subsequently validated in the field.

Indian Forest Cover Change Alert System (InFCCAS): A remote sensing based technique was developed for automated detection of forest cover loss of an area greater than 2 hectare for rapid annual monitoring. The forest pixels are identified on Resourcesat-2 AWiFS data (20 x 20 tiles) for Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Chhattisgarh, Goa, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Rajasthan, Telangana, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal).

Study on Sundarban mangrove system: The mangrove ecosystem of Sundarbans region plays an important ecological and socio-economical role in both India and Bangladesh. The present study is aimed at analysing the impact of cyclone of varying intensity and at different period of phonological cycle on mangrove forests in Sundarbans region. MODIS time-series (2001-2011), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) products were used to compute the MODIS Global Disturbance Index (MGDI). In the present study, instantaneous disturbance caused by the super cyclones was analysed using MGDI approach. The combined impact of ‘SIDR’ and ‘Rashmi’ was successfully captured by the MGDI images of 2008. In case of ‘Aila’, the disturbed area was reasonably less in comparison to the areas with higher EVI changes (-50% to -30%). The spatial extent of disturbance in each island was mapped, which can further be integrated on a temporal scale to generate spatio- temporal severity map. This will help forest management to identify chronically disturbed areas, which may have potential for biological invasion.

Inventory and Monitoring of Glacial Lakes/Water Bodies: The project is being carried out at the behest of Central Water Commission. The inventory of glacial lakes and water bodies was carried out for the year 2009 using IRS satellite data and monitoring in the months from June to October was completed for last four years (2011, 2012, 2013 and 2014). Similar activity for the year 2015 was taken up in June, 2015 for 477 glacial lakes and water bodies. Monthly monitoring reports are submitted.

Assessment of Irrigation Potential Utilisation (I.P.U) using geospatial data: The study has been initiated in April 2015 to assess Irrigation Potential Utilisation (I.P.U) under Major & Medium (M&M) irrigation projects in Krishna basin using the geo-spatial data. Temporal AWiFS data, canal network, project boundaries and LULC data available under various projects (India WRIS, SIS DP, NRC) are being utilised. The data bases such as basin, sub-basin boundaries, M&M projects, their canal network, river/ stream network and other base layers are being organised.

Re-assessment of basin scale water resources using Space inputs: ISRO and Central Water Commission (CWC) jointly executed demonstrative pilot studies in Godavari and Brahmani- Baitarani river basins wherein Space based geo-spatial inputs were used to estimate basin-level mean annual water resources. Ministry of Water Resources recommended upscaling the study to other river basins of the country by regional offices of CWC. CWC regional offices will carry out the study and NRSC will provide technical support and hand holding during the study execution.

Monitoring of Gas Pipelines of Gas Authority of India Ltd (GAIL): GAIL has about 15,000 line km gas pipeline network in India. GAIL and ISRO have undertaken a joint project for studying feasibility of remote sensing, as an alternative/ complement to the helicopter survey, for monitoring the Right of Usage (ROU) of the pipeline for any physical encroachments. A pilot study has been carried out for “Dahej-Vemar-Vijaipur” pipeline segment of about 610 line km. Results indicates that satellite remote sensing techniques (high resolution data) can be used to monitor the pipeline assets through periodic repeat coverage (say monthly) during the cloud-free season. A web application was also developed to demonstrate the usefulness and quick communication within the GAIL monitoring teams.

Island Information System (IIS): Department of Border Management, Ministry of Home Affairs constituted a Task force for holistic development of Islands in Maritime zones of India, with participation of all concerned Ministries/ Departments/ Agencies. Towards this, ISRO has prepared a geospatial inventory of all islands using satellite images and developed an Island Information System. A total of 1238 islands have been identified and reconciled by NRSC/ISRO, SOI, NHO and RGI. The Island Information System (IIS) has been shared with different ministries and departments.

Monitoring of Integrated Watershed Management Programme (IWMP) watersheds using geospatial technologies: Bhuvan – SRISHTI, a Web based GIS application (Geoportal), has been developed to enable monitoring and evaluation of IWMP watersheds, using satellite remote sensing and sample field data (collected using mobile application). This Geoportal would facilitate monitoring and evaluation of all IWMP watersheds for 10 states and 50 identified districts in 28 states. Bhuvan – DRISHTI, an android based interface tool, has been developed for field data capture of the development activities undertaken for the IWMP Projects and includes a facility to upload photos to Bhuvan IWMP Server.

Space-based Information Support for Decentralised Planning (SIS-DP): The project aims at providing web based spatial information comprising of ortho-rectified satellite image, thematic and field data, resource maps, cadastral maps, administrative boundaries, infrastructure layers, climate and socioeconomic data which will act as input for Decentralised Planning at Panchayat level. The project is being executed by respective State Remote Sensing Applications Centres (SRSAC) under the technical guidance and financial support from Overlay of cadastre maps over high resolution satellite image has been completed for 5 States (AP, Telangana, Haryana, Assam and Kerala) and 2 Districts of West Bengal; Bhuvan-Panchayats portal version - 2.0 and Mobile app for Panchayat Raj Institutions (PRI) asset data collection has been demonstrated for operational use. Training on decentralised planning and use of SIS-DP data for planning is being implemented with PRIs through Bhuvan Panchayat.

Snow and Glacier Studies: It is a joint initiative of Ministry of Environment, Forest & Climate Change and Department of Space. Retreat/advance for 73 glaciers spread over different parts of the Himalayan region were estimated using CORONA (1965) and LISS-III (2001) images. Snow cover Atlas of the Bhutan was completed.

Spatial modelling of fluoride contamination in ground water:

The spatial modeling has been for fluoride distribution in ground water using knowledge guided models, data driven models and the combination of both. Fluoride prediction maps generated using hybrid neuro-fuzzy integrated approach compared favourably among the four mathematical models used, namely, weighted overlay, fuzzy overlay, artificial neural network and hybrid neuro-fuzzy models for prediction of fluoride in ground water. Results were validated with field data.

Groundwater storage assessment coupling hydromorphology with lithology: The standard procedure of ground water resource estimation is based on the specific yield parameters of each rock type (lithology) derived through pumping test analysis. However, terrain conditions in the form of geomorphological variations have an important bearing on the net ground water recharge. An attempt was made to use both lithology and geomorphology as input variables to estimate the recharge from different sources in each lithology unit influenced by the geomorphic conditions (lith-geom) season wise separately.

Surface Energy Balance over Agro-ecosystems using Large Aperture Scintillometry: The unique advantage of Scintillometry is its ability to calculate areal averaged sensible heat fluxes over spatial distances comparable to those observed by satellites. The LAS system was set up in 2014 at the agricultural research farm of Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), New Delhi. The LAS measures atmospheric turbulence and heat flux over path lengths between 250 m and 6000 m.

The LAS was augmented with an Automatic Weather Station (AWS) having sensors of net radiometer, pyranometer, anemometer (2 levels), humidity and temperature probes (2 heights) and a soil heat flux plate at 10 cm depth. The 5 min fluxes of net radiation (Rn), sensible heat (H), latent heat (LE) and soil heat (G) fluxes were averaged at hourly intervals. All the fluxes were integrated over the day to analyse their seasonal pattern. Using H and LE daily integrated fluxes, daily values of evaporative fraction, EF = LE/ (H+LE) are calculated and analysed for their seasonal pattern.

ReshaMandi is India’s first and largest digital ecosystem for the natural fibre supply chain, connecting farms to fashion. At ReshaMandi, we are determined to standardise the industry, starting from the grassroots, such as farmers, reelers, weavers, retailers, and finally, consumers. We are digitising the supply chain of natural fibres and eradicating hurdles faced by stakeholders across the chain.

We are offering insights to stakeholders in the natural fibre supply chain. These include weather and soil quality updates and how they could impact cocoons, market linkages of input procurement (cocoon) and selling output (yarns), maintaining ledgers, information on best practices and purchasing machine tools. ReshaMandi’s innovative technique is revolutionising natural fibre farming in India. We are successfully using the Internet of Things (IoT) to boost agricultural productivity. Since most farmers lack tech skills, any technology should be extremely easy for all parties to use.

ReshaMandi’s technological intervention and people-first approach have helped farmers improve their productivity by 20 per cent and boost incomes by nearly 30 per cent, enabling them to afford better quality raw materials, high-quality labour, fertilisers, and other essential inputs, which are pushing yields higher.

You’re creating a tech-enabled value chain for silk, how is it different from the conventional value chain?

India is the second-largest producer of raw silk in the world. Notwithstanding that, the industry still faces many hurdles such as volatile yields, price fluctuations of cocoons, and arbitrary testing methods by silk reelers. Issues such as lack of standardisation, poor database management, and a diverse range of practices leading to fluctuations in production and quality are still plaguing the sector. As we work at the grassroots levels, we have been able to gauge the needs of stakeholders to address the same. We have effectively integrated technology into the supply chain, ensuring all stakeholders reap the benefits.

We provide IoT devices for measuring soil pH and moisture content, sunlight, air quality, humidity, and temperature. With the help of mobile apps, IoT gadgets, AI, and tech-enabled devices, ReshaMandi is empowering farmers to raise production, lower wastage, improve quality, and, thereby, increase their income. Our IoT devices assist silk farmers in analysing the silkworm-rearing process and identifying the best irrigation practices for higher yields of mulberry plants that are the main feed for worms

ReshaMandi has a network of 23 procurement centres where farmers can get in touch with representatives, either through a phone call or by visiting the centre in person with a prior appointment. Farmers have the option to pick up inputs directly or order through the app with the representative’s help. We have the flexibility to book an appointment with them to collect the cocoons from the farmer’s house to avoid a long journey to the mandis.

What technologies do you apply in creating this supply chain?

We have been incorporating several technologies such as machine learning, AI, data analytics, and IoT, to name a few. The result is the ReshaMandi super-app – one app that can be used by stakeholders across the supply chain. We recently released a new IoT device, which has been researched, developed, and engineered by ReshaMandi to improve the previous version of our IoT device for farmers. Last month, we launched the ReshaMandi App for iOS devices and stakeholders using iOS devices have begun using this app. Previously it was available only on an android platform.

Kindly describe the silk economy in India with factors like production, exports, number of farmers associated with silk cultivation, challenges in market linkages, innovations coming in, and geographical distribution.

India is the second-largest producer and largest consumer of silk with a production value amounting to 34000 MT. The market for raw silk was valued at US$2.5 billion in FY22, whereas consumption volume stood at 40,000 MT. The southern zone (Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and Kerala) accounts for 59 per cent of the total silk production. According to IBEF, The most exported silk items from India remain silk fabrics and garments, with export shares of 45.3 per cent and 36.3 per cent in 2021-22, respectively. Silk waste (11.3 per cent), silk carpets (4.3 per cent), and natural silk yarn (2.8 per cent) make up most of India’s overall silk exports.

The silk industry is highly unorganised with problems such as price fluctuations, absence of proper markets, lack of proper logistics, no definitive advisory, minimal quality testing, and no transparency in the processes. This being a buyers’ market, farmers are often subjected to cartel practices to drive down prices. We aim to eliminate uncertainties in the ecosystem, presenting a completely transparent process to farmers.

What challenges do you face while your operations with the farmers and how do you tackle them?

The first few days were extremely challenging. We had to educate the farmers as well as all our other stakeholders about our platform and the value it offers, including the advancement that ReshaMandi brings. Once we convinced a handful of people, it was just a matter of networking within stakeholder communities. Today, through our super app, we have successfully enabled 100 per cent of farmers on the platform to transact digitally. Most often, under the guise of low product quality, stakeholders in this ecosystem are exploited and underpaid. This is mostly because they don’t grasp the value of their produce in the market. By educating them about the latest tech solutions, such as Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, we are striving to eliminate such issues. Since our inception, tech innovations have revolutionised the country’s natural fibre supply chain, greatly enhancing the ability to control this unorganised sector.

Kindly tell us a few success stories on your interventions transforming the farmer value chain.

One such case concerns Gurumallesh, a BA graduate and a rare example of a well-educated young person choosing to forego city life to pursue a successful career in sericulture. He started on a small piece of land. Today, he owns a nice house, a 4.5-acre farm, and two silkworm-rearing houses. He now cultivates only silk and boasts 150 kg of produce every month.

ReshaMandi’s technology intervention helped Gurumallesh and farmers like him get higher margins and enabled them to afford better quality raw materials, higher quality labour, fertilisers, and other essential inputs, which in turn are pushing yields even higher.

Do you have any plans to diversify your portfolio? If yes, kindly elucidate.

In early 2020, we began the journey with silk. In FY22, however, we added other natural fibres such as cotton, coir, jute, and banana to the portfolio, managing the entire ecosystem for all natural fibres catering to a diverse set of stakeholders.

The growing population is imposing a big pressure on natural resources. Do you also advocate sustainable practices among the farmers associated with you?

Since the beginning of our journey, we have been a proponent of sustainable fashion. We have been collaborating closely with farmers to recycle silk and cocoon wastes (produced by farmlands and reeling units, respectively), which are now being used to extract sericin – a silk protein that is used in the pharmaceutical and packaging industries. Pupae (a by-product of reeling operations) can be used for fish and poultry feeding. Earlier farmers would burn mulberry twigs as they did not know how crucial these are as raw materials in the cosmetics, pharmaceutical and FMCG industries. We are working closely with farmers to recycle agricultural waste in other businesses.

What markets do you cater to for exporting the commodities you are operating in?

We now have global footprints and plans to become a one-stop natural and recycled fibres sourcing platform in various countries including the Middle East, Europe, North and South America, and South East Asia (SEA) to replicate its successful India model. We have already entered MENA and SEA regions as both these markets are rapidly emerging and are the world’s fastest-growing apparel and textile hubs.

In what geographical areas do you operate and how many farmers benefit from your solutions?

Besides our 23 procurement centres and 4 cocoon sales centres across India, we run 25 mandis (big markets) across Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, and Maharashtra. We are present in four weaving clusters in some of India’s silk capitals – Varanasi, Dharmavaram, Salem, and Kanchipuram. We began working with the farmers in Sarjapura, Karnataka, and today we have expanded our operations to almost 5,000 pin codes across India. We also aim to increase our retail footprint further into Agra, Kota, Gorakhpur, Dhanbad, Ranchi, Bhopal, Indore, Jabalpur, Rajkot, Vadodara, Surat, Pune, Nagpur, Satara, Visakhapatnam, Vijayawada, Madurai, Coimbatore, Kochi, and Kannur. Currently, we are working with over 60,000 farmers.

What strategies do you apply to reach the farming community to increase their association with ReshaMandi?

Our business approach has had a substantial impact on farmers’ productivity and revenue. Being a closed community, word-of-mouth has helped us win the trust of farmers. Continuous efforts and development for the betterment of stakeholders is our only approach to maintaining an association with them. Our executives are constantly engaging in periodic activities for farmers, organising sessions to enlighten them on the benefits of technology and the empowerment we can bring to them.

What new offerings are you going to bring in the future?

We have announced our new venture ReshaMudra, which will give business partners across the ecosystem access to working capital solutions as well as long-term loans, enabling them to secure crucial funding to help grow their businesses or tide over challenging times. As mentioned earlier we have launched a unique programme called ReshaAbhivrudi which will resolve problems related to crop yields, crop loss, lack of advisories, and more.

Moreover, we have introduced an industry-first, trend forecast report that will predict fashion trends and shape the industry over a year. The report will share market intelligence and map consumer behaviour, allowing designers, exporters, and retailers to better plan inventory and manage operations well. We have already entered the global markets via Southeast Asia and the Middle East and plan to become a one-stop sourcing solution for natural fibres globally.

“Millets have a glorious history of being among the earliest crops grown by humans,” Modi stated in his address to the opening ceremony of the ""International Year of Millets 2023,"" which was held at the headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) in Rome, Italy. In the past, they were an important source of food. However, the urgent requirement is to provide them with a food option for the future.



Modi said, “A global movement related to millets is an important step since they are easy to grow, climate resilient, and drought resistant.”

Millet production in India

Jowar (sorghum), bajra (pearl millet), and ragi (finger millet) are the three main millet crops that are currently being grown in India. India also produces a wide variety of indigenous, biogenetically diverse ""small millets"" like kodo, kutki, chenna, and sanwa. Rajasthan, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Gujarat, and Haryana. are the major producers of millet in the country.

BCCL/Representational Image

According to a PIB report, the production of millets has increased from 14.52 million tonnes in 2015-16 to 17.96 million tonnes in 2020-21.

Millets can be grown in mountainous, low-fertility, dry, rain-fed, and tribal areas. It requires less labor-intensive cultivation, has shorter cultivation cycles, and is beneficial to the soil. Millets can be a long-term source of income for farmers due to low investment requirements.

Significance of millets

PM Modi said millets benefit consumers, farmers, and the environment. They are a good source of a healthy diet; they benefit the cultivators and the climate since they need lesser water and are viable with regular approaches to cultivating.

“There is a need for diversity on the land and on our tables. If agriculture becomes monoculture, it impacts our health and the health of our lands. Millets are a good way to increase agricultural and dietary diversity,” he added.

BCCL/Representational Image

Millets are a sustainable food source for combating hunger in a changing global climate because they are resistant to climatic stress, pests, and diseases. Further, millets do not require a lot of water or other resources, making them a long-term option for combating climate change and constructing climate-resilient agri-food systems.

Nutri-cereals are a powerhouse of nutrients, including iron, folate, calcium, zinc, magnesium, phosphorus, copper, vitamins, and antioxidants. Millets are high in dietary fiber. They have been shown to lower the risk of heart disease and diabetes in adults, in addition to being crucial for children's healthy growth and development.

Millets, which are free of gluten and have a low glycemic index, are beneficial to diabetics and can assist in preventing cardiovascular disease and nutritional deficiency.

Initiatives by the government to promote millet

The government increased the MSP of millets, providing farmers with a significant price incentive. The government has included millets in the public distribution system to ensure a steady market for the produce.

BCCL/Representational Image

The government has made seed kits and other inputs available to farmers helped build value chains through Farmer Producer Organizations and made millets more marketable.

The Ministry of Women and Child Development has been establishing Nutri-gardens, promoting research on the connections between crop diversity and dietary diversity, and running a behaviour change campaign to increase consumer demand for Nutri-cereals.

BRS launch:Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao renamed his party, TRS, as the Bharat Rashtra Samithi

A one-line resolution to rename the party was passed at the TRS general body meeting after over 230 delegates signed it.

Rao, popularly known as KCR, who has been rallying regional parties against the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of the national elections, read out the resolution announcing the new name at 1.19 pm, considered to be auspicious.

Amid thumping of desks, claps and cheers by party delegates, KCR said the party’s constitution has been amended to rename the TRS as BRS. Party workers, who gathered outside the Telangana Bhavan in large numbers, burst crackers and raised “Desh Ka Neta KCR” slogans.

In a brief speech, KCR explained the reasons for the transition. He said the purpose for which the TRS was floated in April 2001 was achieved with the formation of the state of Telangana and making it the number one state in the country on all fronts in the last eight years.

“Now, it is time to take the Telangana model of development to the entire country. Even after 75 years of independence, India has remained backward in many areas, lagging behind smaller countries such as Bangladesh. The country has not been able to harness the full potential in agriculture and irrigation,” he regretted.

The chief minister said that the BRS will take a lead role in providing an alternative development model for the country, and will make all-out efforts to put India on the global map of developed nations.

KCR has been meeting chiefs of regional parties over the last year as part of his efforts to unite them for a third political alternative against the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) and the Congress. In Telangana, KCR’s party has been on a collision course with the BJP and called for a BJP-mukt Bharat, accusing it of fanning communalism and practising divisive politics.

Janata Dal (Secular) leader and former Karnataka chief minister HD Kumaraswamy, president of Viduthalai Chirutagal Katchi (VMK) and Chidambaram MP Tholkappiyan Thirumavalavan and some farm leaders were among those present at the occasion.

TRS leaders had earlier indicated KCR may announce the launch of the new party and merge the TRS into it. But the plan was tweaked and a decision was taken to rename the party to be able to retain its flag, election symbol, and organisational structure.

A party leader said KCR will be elected as BRS national president and that he will also name a Telangana unit chief.

Soon after the meeting, senior TRS leader and former MP B Vinod Kumar and other senior leaders left for New Delhi with a letter addressed to the Election Commission of India, communicating the change of the party’s name.

KCR last month announced free electricity for farmers across the country if a BRS-led front is voted to power in the 2024 election and accused the Centre of pressuring the states to end welfare schemes on the pretext that they were freebies.

In August, KCR met Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar and backed the Janata Dal-United leader’s call for a united opposition ahead of the 2024 elections. It was the latest in his series of such meetings as part of efforts to build an alternative alliance.

KCR visited Bihar days after Nitish Kumar’s ended his alliance with the BJP for a second time to align with Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD), Congress, and Left parties.

Seaweed has now been certified by ICRISAT, Hyderabad, as an active biofertilizer and with organic farming catching on, seaweed sap as fertilizer is bound to break new ground

By Telangana Today Published Date - 12:30 AM, Mon - 26 September 22

By M Krishnan and Ramasubramanian V

Imagine using a shopping bag that could disintegrate in hot water or dissolve in minutes in normal water. This and many more innovative seaweed products are already in the market and set to make strong waves. Seaweed is a macroalgae that thrives in marine waters. With some innovative ocean farming networking strategies, the fast growing weed would easily scale well. Seaweed absorbs CO2 much faster than any land-based plant or tree. Some seaweed can grow as fast as two metres a day absorbing CO2 fast and reducing ocean acidity.

Global Output

What has been done in this sector thus far? The seaweed global output is expected to reach $26 billion by 2025. Under the Pradhan Mantri Matsay Sampada Yojana (PMMSY), the Centre has put Rs 640 crore into the seaweed business with the hope that production could be enhanced to 10 crore tonnes by 2025. AquAgri Private Limited, New Delhi, is the pioneer in Kappaphycus alvarezii seaweed culture along the Palk Bay, Mandapam, Ramanathapuram district of Tamil Nadu. It started its operations after buying off this business from PepsiCo, which entered the seaweed culture business in the early 2000s with a hired labour model that failed. AqaAgri started operations in 2008 in a network model comprising self-help groups of fishers of Mandapam villages, the Department of Fisheries, Tamil Nadu (DoFTN), local nationalised banks and not-for-profit organisation Aquaculture Foundation of India (AFI), Chennai. The seedlings and equipment were given to the seaweed farmers in the first round and the output was bought off the SHGs by the company directly after crediting their accounts with their payouts.

The banks had no second thoughts in financing the SHGs for inputs and equipment in the subsequent rounds as payments for the EMI were deducted from the accounts of the seaweed farmers. The DoFTN and AFI played a magnificent role in providing extension service, technology updates and training. This network worked too well and fed the input needs of the carrageenan manufacturing factory of AquAgri in Manamadurai, Tamil Nadu. Fishers and their families belonging to more than 18 fish landing villages in Mandapam area directly benefitted from this initiative. This seaweed movement that started as a women SHG activity flourished and attracted their men folk, who then took over the offshore raft seeding and management and the women took care of in-shore seaweed drying activities.

A seaweed culture raft worth Rs 2,000 can be planted with 70 kg of seaweed saplings which would yield 230 kg of seaweed after 45 days. Each kilo of seaweed is worth Rs 60-75 per Kg. Therefore, if a family has 40-45 rafts in operation, the daily take is estimated to be as much as Rs 800 per day.

Outreach Activity

One of the latest in the scene for helping out seaweed farmers in this region is Grow-Trees, a not-for-profit organization, which provides expertise and equipment in seaweed cultivation in key areas in Mandapam coastal villages that include Munaikkadu. This outreach activity is expected to benefit at least 750 people in the area. The objective of this outreach is to enhance fishers’ income and self-reliance. This initiative will be replicated by Grow-Trees in other parts of India too. The Grow-Trees in their baseline survey has documented that only 15 families in this village had information and equipment for seaweed culture. This organisation provided training and equipment to the locals in the first round of assistance. Education is a priority area for these villagers and they are grateful for the new initiative that helps them to send their children to school.

Make in India

In addition to products that need seaweed as a base resource for manufacturing, the Make in India movement also drives the initiative. Seaweed is a raw material that is much in demand for manufacturers of agar, agarose, carrageenan and alginates. The hospitality industry is a newbie generating demand for seaweed. Chefs in star hotels in the metros, including the Taj Mumbai, are experimenting with dry seaweed in their kitchens. Seaweed lends piquancy to their dishes as salad or soup garnishing and brings the unique Umami flavour to their vegetarian offerings. Chefs are discovering that normal butter spliced with seaweed brings in flavours yet unsavoured. Chicken nuggets are spliced with alginate seaweed extract to help keep the meat remain moist and fresh.

Seaweed has always served as a food stabilising agent. When processed into agar, it can withstand high temperatures. Hence it is a favourite medium for stabilising and thickening ice-creams, pies, cakes, icings and meringues. The bland-tasting seaweed helps inhibit crystallisation of ice. Agar-agar is the main ingredient in falooda and in Tamil Nadu’s famous Jigarthanda. Seaweed cultured in a controlled environment could result in a horizontal expansion of the market with its properties rich in vitamins and minerals.

Seaweed has now been certified by ICRISAT, Hyderabad, as a safe and active biofertilizer. The seaweed sap has been tested on cotton and found to help faster germination of the seeds. The Indian Farmers Fertilizer Cooperative (IFFCO) insights into the potentiality of seaweed as a biofertilizer have led AquAgri to manufacture the seaweed sap of the red and brown algae as a fertilizer. With organic farming catching on, seaweed sap as fertilizer is bound to break new ground in enhancing agricultural production and productivity. Seaweed is also an active ingredient in anti-obesity, anti-arthritic and anti-diabetic tablets. Dissolvable bio-film dressings from seaweed extracts are on the anvil. Seaweed wine, sushi in seaweed wraps are other products are much awaited new arrivals in the Indian market.

Active containment of negative market forces that break the smooth functioning of the seaweed farming network is essential. Natural calamities have wrought havoc on seaweed farming in the Mandapam region. Kappaphycus seed banks need a scientific approach in development, secure safe keeping off-shore and distribution to enable restoration of farming activities quickly after a cyclonic cycle. Private investments in seaweed farming and identification of sites suitable for seaweed farming besides Mandapam, Porbandar and Kakinada need serious examination and quick action. The volume needs of the market must be met on a war footing to retain market interest, product development efforts and market expansion.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Sea-weed.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-the-weed-that-isnt

New Delhi: Satellite images shows that China has built villages on their side of the India-China border abutting Arunachal Pradesh’s Tawang, and the PLA army has also constructed a road on that side, Indian Army sources said on Tuesday, a day after a clash between troops of both sides last week became public.

The Indian Air Force scrambled fighter jets last week following China’s increasing air activities, people familiar with the matter said. The deployment of some aerial platforms including drones by China in the region preceded the Chinese attempts on December 9 to unilaterally change the status quo in the Yangtse area of the Tawang sector, they said.

The people said a number of Chinese drones flew close to the LAC prompting the IAF to scramble the jets and increase the overall combat readiness.

They said the IAF has also stepped up its overall surveillance in areas in view of the Chinese attempt of transgression on December 9, adding it follows standard operation procedures that included scrambling of fighter jets in case of specific security concerns.

“The situation is being monitored closely by both the IAF and the Army,” said one of the people cited above.

The people indicated that the IAF has increased the frequency of sorties by its combat jets in the region.

On the clash, sources said that as many as 300 Chinese troops had arrived near the LAC on December 9 to gain control over the peak of a 17,000-feet-high mountain under a well-planned conspiracy, but the Indian troops foiled their attempt, the source said. Although, China has maintained that the situation on its border with India is stable but according to sources, the Chinese soldiers had come with barbed sticks near the LAC on December 9. India has taken a tough stand on the clash between Indian and Chinese soldiers. A meeting with the chiefs of all three Armed Forces, the CDS, and the NSA was also called by the Defence Minister. The clash between Indian and Chinese troops on December 9 took place at the 17,000 feet at Yangtse, some 35 km north-east of Tawang in western Arunachal Pradesh.

China has been repeatedly trying to take control of the 17,000-feet-high peak but Indian Army sources said that India has a firm control of the peak, which provides a commanding view on both sides of the border.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/china-23.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/china-built-villages-constructed-road-near-border

210,68-YO Turns Ancestral Land Into Forest With 5 Crore Trees,2022-05-11 11:59:18+00:00,['Himanshu Nitnaware'],"['seeds', 'dusharla', 'plants', '68yo', 'birds', 'crore', 'wildlife', 'family', 'land', 'turns', 'forest', 'india', 'ancestral', 'trees']","In the village of Raghavpura, located in Telangana’s Suryapet district, lies a 70-acre forest teeming with lakhs of fruit-bearing trees.

The area was once a grazing land, where I used to spread tamarind and seeds of other plants.
A rough estimate shows about 5 crore trees, many of which have regenerated via the forest ecosystem itself,” he says.
“Considering my forest has spread across 70 acres of land and left out a few empty spaces, there are over five crore trees,” he says.","In the village of Raghavpura, located in Telangana’s Suryapet district, lies a 70-acre forest teeming with lakhs of fruit-bearing trees. Some of these are over 50 years old, and some have grown in the last three decades. The area is home to hundreds of birds and several wildlife species.

From the outside, it looks like any other forest in various parts of southern India. But take a closer look, and you’ll find many unique aspects.

For starters, the forest has no protective fence, gates, or security guards. It does not belong to the government or forest department. Instead, the entire area falls under the protection of a single guardian — Dusharla Satyanarayana.

The 68-year-old has neither bought this land, nor leased it. Instead, he has used the ancestral land that he spent his childhood in to create a thriving ecosystem.

Work of exemplary passion

“I have been creating the forest since the age of four. The area was once a grazing land, where I used to spread tamarind and seeds of other plants. It was due to my passion and love for nature from an early age that I wanted to have trees around me,” he tells The Better India.

Dusharla says he spent his childhood around many birds and animals, and formed a deep bond with the biodiversity around him. He comes from Patwari family — landlords or land accountants of the village. He says that his family owned 300 acres of land.

“The Nizams ruled the area until the late 1940s. My ancestors worked under them and had control over the vast land, which they mainly used for pasteur, irrigation, and farming purposes,” he says.

In 1948, the family became the sole owner of the land, after the Nizam-controlled region merged to become an integral part of India. As Dusharla grew older, his love for nature only grew stronger.

Over time, the family’s ownership reduced to 70 acres. This, he says, was because great-grandfather and grandfather lost most of the property. “Relatives and friends tampered with documents and seized the land. This part of land is the last bit that has remained under my possession, and continues to face similar threats,” he says.

“My father still owned 70 acres, and I started spreading seeds to generate a forest. My parents did not oppose me as they realised my positive intent to contribute to the environment. Often, my classmates or villagers entered the plantations or tried to harvest resources. I always shooed them away,” he notes.

Today, his 50 years of efforts are visible in the tall trees thriving in the forest.

In his younger days, Dusharla travelled far and wide to places across India to collect seeds and saplings of forest species. He dug a canal to harvest rainwater and channelise it to irrigate the plants, and built ponds where lotus, fish, frogs and tortoises live in abundance.

In 1980, he graduated in agriculture science, and began working as a field officer for the Union Bank of India. He spent all of his savings to create and maintain the forest.

Today, this land thrives with tree varieties such as guava, Indian jujube, cluster fig, jamun, guava, carandas plum, mango, bamboo, and others.

Dusharla says that not even a single fruit or forest resource goes out for commercial purposes or human consumption. “Everything that grows here is consumed by thousands of birds, different species of snakes, rabbits, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, monkeys, peacocks, deer, and other wildlife. What is left unconsumed decomposes and plays an important part in rejuvenating the forest. A rough estimate shows about 5 crore trees, many of which have regenerated via the forest ecosystem itself,” he says.

He explains further, “A dense tree vegetation is said to be a forest if there are adequate plant species of medicinal value, agricultural and horticultural varieties, and significant flora to maintain the biodiversity. The forest is also recognised and determined by large trunks, fruit-bearing plants, and their distribution and regeneration.”

Dusharla says that on an average, there are about 10 lakh trees per acre in the forest. “Considering my forest has spread across 70 acres of land and left out a few empty spaces, there are over five crore trees,” he says.

He adds, “The birds pollinate and spread seeds, the plants grow into trees, the wildlife contributes its bit, and the forest also plays an important role in maintaining the groundwater levels.”

No compromises for the environment

Retired IFS officer Raghuveer, in a documentary highlighting Dusharla’s efforts, says, “Dusharla is a passionate nature lover, and it is impressive to see him devoting his life to creating a forest, especially without any support from the government or private individuals. Such efforts need to be replicated and sustained. His work is an inspiration for younger generations.”

Meanwhile, Dusharla notes that while neighbouring landowners and real estate developers often try to convince him to give the land away, he is adamant about protecting it at all costs.

“I have protected the land for the past three generations. Many family members express their willingness to commercialise the land. Some have even offered Rs 100 crore. But I will not let it go for non-environmental reasons. Even my children are not heir to the land,” he says.

He also notes that it is time that humans understand the importance of environmental protection and conservation. “Humans pose a danger to the existence of forests and wildlife. Wildlife exists only because of the presence of forests. If there is no home for them, they will venture out into human settlements. Beyond maintaining the environmental balance, the forests play a crucial role in preventing human-animal conflict, and hence their survival is crucial,” he says.

The Supreme Court July 27, 2022 ordered status quo on the Kaleshwaram Lift Irrigation Project (KLIP) after it was told Telangana government was increasing the capacity of the project without any environmental clearances.

A bench comprising Justice AM Khanwilkar, Justice Abhay S Oka and Justice JB Pardiwala served notices to the state and Union governments for taking up the expansion work of KLIP without adequate clearances.

KLIP currently draws 2 billion cubic (tmc) feet of water and was being expanded to draw 3 tmc feet of water every day. It is one of the largest such projects in the world.

The Telangana government told the court that the petitions questioning the project’s expansion were politically motivated. It claimed that the farmers whom the expansion would impact had already accepted compensation from the government.

The state government further said they had environmental clearance for the original lift irrigation project. The same authorisation would hold good for the expansion as well.

The apex court was hearing six petitions related to the compensation and land acquisition filed by the project oustees.

The Supreme Court will next take up hearings in the case on August 23, 2022.

The Kaleshwaram irrigation project is a bone of contention between Telangana Rashtra Samithi (TRS) that holds the office and the Opposition.

Bharatiya Janata Party chief JP Nadda January 2022 had alleged that Chief Minister of Telangana, K C Rao, had spent Rs 1,20,000 crore on the irrigation project till now, but the water was yet to reach the residents.

The project was originally worth Rs 36,000 crore. “Kaleshwaram has become an ATM for KCR. The water has only reached his farmhouse and nowhere else,” Nadda had said, as reported by media outlet Financial Times.

The project was in the news a fortnight ago after it got flooded.

Incessant rains in the catchment areas of the Godavari river earlier this month had led to the floods that had severely affected KLIP. Two huge pumping stations were inundated and another was partially damaged, a report by media outlet Hindustan Times said.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2020-04-08/0.53404700_1586342782_supreme-court.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/water/supreme-court-orders-status-quo-on-kaleshwaram-irrigation-project-expansion-84017

There is 13.27 per cent less area under paddy in 2022, compared to last year, even as the sowing of paddy was completed by the end of July in most parts of the country. Paddy is one of the main food grains grown in the kharif season that starts in June and ends in October.

Some 23.15 million hectares (mha) of paddy had been sown by July 29, 2022, according to data released by the Union agriculture ministry. This is 3.55 mha less than what was sown in 2021 during the corresponding period.

The gap between paddy acreage in 2022 and in the ‘normal’ area under paddy by July end is much more — at 41.6 per cent. ‘Normal’ sown area for this time of the sowing season is 39.7 mha.

The target area under paddy for 2022 was higher, at 41.31 mha. The primary reason for the reduced sown area is the failure of the monsoon in the month of June and of its smooth progression in July in most parts of the country.

Two days ago, Union Minister for Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar, mentioned that there was a possibility of covering the shortfall in paddy sowing in the ongoing kharif season. However, that possibility looks bleak as the sowing of paddy usually gets over by now.

Less sown area has been reported from 17 states — West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Jharkhand, Telangana, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Tripura, Assam, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Meghalaya, Haryana, Mizoram, Uttarakhand, Jammu and Kashmir and Sikkim.

Overall, the monsoon has been ‘above normal’ by eight per cent till July 31, according to data from the India Meteorological Department. But at least six of the leading rice-producing states — WB, UP, Bihar, Jhakhand, Mizoram and Tripura — have recorded a deficit rainfall, with many districts even recording a ‘large deficit’.

A few other important crops are also lagging behind in their acreage. In pulses, arhar (pigeonpea) which has the maximum area under the pulses basket in the kharif season has fallen short by 13.5 per cent, compared to last year.

The sowing has fallen in the top five arhar-producing states of Maharashtra, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh. However, the overall area under pulses has increased by 0.29 mha, which is attributed to mostly higher production of moong (green gram).

The acreage of maize, another important kharif crop, has also fallen by around five per cent. The overall area under kharif crops has decreased by 1.82 mha, compared to 2021 and by 26 mha compared to ‘normal’ sown area by this time of the year.

June and July are the two most important months in which the farmers complete their kharif sowing, as 61 per cent of Indian farmers practice rainfed agriculture.

Down To Earth has been reporting how farmers across India have been unable to sow or have been losing their crops this kharif season, owing to low or no rainfall.

This also raises worry about India’s Public Distribution System (PDS), of which rice is main food item. Up to July 31, the Food Corporation of India has procured 589.78 lakh metric tonnes (LMT) in the kharif marketing season.

The current rice stocks are at 548.58 LMT (including unmilled paddy), much higher than the stocking norm as of July 1 at 135.40 LMT.

But this will be just enough to meet the total rice allocation of around 565 LMT under various schemes during 2022-23. And the situation has become only more complicated after the low wheat crop due to a scorching heat wave in March.

This resulted in a record drop (56.6 per cent) in the government’s wheat procurement for the rabi marketing season 2022-23. Already, wheat is being substituted with rice in many states after a cut in their wheat allocation under the National Food Security Act (NFSA), 2013.

Meanwhile, lower rice production has also led to rice prices showing an upward trend. According to latest data by the Union Ministry of Consumer Affairs, rice prices were at Rs 37.02 per kg as of July 31. They were Rs 36.41 per kg a month ago and Rs 35.55 a year ago.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2022-08-01/0.30635100_1659366480_0.jpg,[],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/agriculture/kharif-2022-area-under-paddy-dips-by-13-as-july-ends-84093

216,Why the 11th Agricultural Census promises to be a game-changer,,[],"['data', 'operational', 'promises', 'farmers', 'gamechanger', 'holdings', 'agricultural', 'census', 'number', 'land', 'india', 'records', '11th']","The number of small and marginal agricultural landholdings, known as operational holdings, marginally increased in 2015-16 when compared to 2010-11.
The last census put the number of operational holdings at 1.09 million.
The government has maintained that operational holdings and not ownership holdings will remain the basis of census data collection.
The Agricultural Census also serves as an eye-opener on farm opportunities in order to tap global markets.
Though the 11th Agricultural Census has had a delayed start, due to the pandemic, it is poised to be a watershed in the exercise that made its debut in 1970-71.","The nationwide 11th Agricultural Census— ronce-in-five-years count—that gets underway this August is for the first time using technology and also taking into account digitised land records, such as land title records and survey reports, to ensure better accuracy of data. “The computation of data will bring huge benefits in a vast agricultural country like India,” said Union minister for agriculture and farmer welfare Narendra Singh Tomar at the launch of the enumeration exercise on July 28. Tomar urged officials to carry out the census with total dedication since nearly half the country’s population depends on agriculture for a livelihood.



Digital technologies are providing the springboard for more confidence in farm-related data generated by the government. Perhaps the most critical challenge is estimating the correct number of farmers in India, considering that all policies and financial allocations depend on these numbers and more and more states are taking to presenting exclusive agriculture budgets.

According to the 10thAgricultural Census (2015-16), small and marginal farmers—those with less than two hectares of land—accounted for 86.2 per cent of all farmers in the country but they owned just 47.3 per cent of the crop area. The number of small and marginal agricultural landholdings, known as operational holdings, marginally increased in 2015-16 when compared to 2010-11. This meant more people now owned smaller parcels of farmland, a key reason for lack of scale in the national farm output.

The 10th census estimated the number of farmers at 146.5 million, based on operational landholdings. In several states, the farmer populations estimated were found to be far below the actual numbers. This came to light after the launch of the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi scheme, which is based on Aadhar-linked verification of land-owning farmers. The last census put the number of operational holdings at 1.09 million.



Resolving this is critical to making pragmatic financial assessments and allocations. The government has maintained that operational holdings and not ownership holdings will remain the basis of census data collection. The census operation is conducted in three phases. Operational holding is taken as a statistical unit at the micro level for data collection. Based on this data, three detailed reports analysing trends are published on various parameters at the all India, state and Union territory levels.

However, with the advent of technology and use of digital devices, smartphones and tablets, Krishi Bhavan mandarins are hopeful of getting more realistic numbers this time to make their calculations and analysis. They are guided by the experience of technology infusion in crop insurance, which has yielded better results. Using drones and validation with digitised land records will help reduce manual discrepancies in data as well as verify the statistical methodology. The use of digitised land records and mobile apps for data collection will enable real-time monitoring of the progress made. Most states had already digitised their land records and surveys, which will further accelerate the collection of data.

The Agricultural Census is the databank to mine information about the sector on a variety of parameters at a relatively minute level, such as number and size of operational holdings, their class-wise distribution, land use, tenancy and cropping pattern. “The government is focusing on increasing farmers’ incomes. Besides, there is a need to improve their standard of living, organise small farmers in order to empower them as well as attract them towards remunerative crops,” said Tomar.

The Agricultural Census also serves as an eye-opener on farm opportunities in order to tap global markets. “India has the highest cultivable land with many agro-climatic advantages but this is not being used optimally. The inconsistent export policies and lack of long-term export plans have resulted in loss of many global market opportunities. Very few crops are of international standards with traceability,” says P. Chengal Reddy, advisor, Consortium of Indian Farmers Associations. “The shortfalls revealed by the census will enable the Union government to adopt more pragmatic policies in accessing technologies, allowing investments including FDI, and introducing changes in the Essential Commodities Act to propel India as a global player in agriculture.”

Analysts point out with improved accuracy in data-gathering, more sustainable policy interventions are possible. It can provide a better understanding of mapping of crops with more ‘ground truths’ to match what is generated through satellite imagery and other remote-sensing data. Analysts also say the 11th Agricultural Census may well herald the arrival of ‘Digital Agriculture’—a series of information and communication technology (ICT) driven data ecosystems to support the development and delivery of timely and targeted information and services to make farming profitable and sustainable. There is also a need to build a robust digital infrastructure consisting of satellite imaging, soil health information, land record, cropping pattern and frequency and market data.

An area of great promise to deploy ICT is agricultural biotechnology, which includes a range of tools, including traditional breeding techniques that alter living organisms, to make or modify products, improve plants or animals, or develop microorganisms for specific agricultural uses. Another is to enable digital and wireless technologies for data measurement, weather monitoring, robotics and drones. A third ICT-based strategy is ‘Precision Agriculture’. This is an approach where inputs are utilised in precise amounts to get increased average yields compared to traditional cultivation techniques such as agroforestry, inter-cropping and crop rotation.

The ministry of agriculture and farmer welfare has planned the creation of AgriStack, a collection of technology-based interventions to create a unified platform for farmers to provide them end-to-end services. Another initiative is the Unified Farmer Service Platform, which will act as a medium of data exchange among various schemes and services to enable comprehensive delivery of services to the farmer. Though the 11th Agricultural Census has had a delayed start, due to the pandemic, it is poised to be a watershed in the exercise that made its debut in 1970-71. It can help the country brace for climate-smart agriculture.

Hyderabad: The State government is promoting high density cotton cultivation in about 20,000 acres in Telangana from this Vaanakalam (Kharif) season on a pilot basis. Based on the results, this highly profitable method will be increased to cover wider area from next Vaanakalam season.

Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy, who is on a tour of the US, visited the Bayer Cotton Seed, Crop and Genetic Research Station at St Louis. He was accompanied by MLAs Methuku Anand, Ravindra Naik, Peddi Sudharshan Reddy and Telangana State Seeds Development Corporation managing director K Keshavulu, among others.

In a statement, Niranjan Reddy said the US had adopted modern methods using farm mechanisation for cotton cultivation on a large scale. The high density cultivation method was yielding good results and higher yield in the US which can be adopted in Telangana. “India is the leader in cotton production in the world with 6.2 million tonnes of production every year. Adopting new technologies, Telangana can become the largest cotton producer in the country and also cement the nation’s position,” he said.

The Minister said farm mechanisation would not only reduce input costs, but also increase yield and overcome labour shortage. Maharashtra is the largest producer of cotton in the country, followed by Telangana. The representatives of Bayer Group offered to supply new seed varieties pertaining to crops like cotton, maize and vegetables, he said.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Niranjan-Reddy-55.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/telangana-govt-to-promote-high-density-cotton-cultivation

States could undertake procurement, crop insurance, and transfers but the union government would not finance these.","New Delhi: A handful of states in northern India corner most of the central subsidies and transfers to farmers, finds a new paper co-authored by former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian.

Titled ‘Agricultural Federalism: New Facts, Constitutional Vision’, the paper, published in Economic and Political Weekly on 3 September proposes a radical reform agenda, including putting states in charge of agriculture.

The study argues that state governments should provide tailored incentives and subsidies to their farmers while the central government should focus on research and risk mitigation to deal with adverse climate events.

The study also mentions “attribution stakes” — or credit wars over government schemes — as another affliction assailing Indian agriculture.

Besides Subramanian, the paper was co-authored by Shoumitro Chatterjee, Devesh Kapur, and Pradyut Sekhsaria.

The study found that central subsidies and transfers on five different heads — procurement from farmers at support prices, fertiliser subsidies, direct income transfers, cost of maintaining food stocks, and payments towards states taxes on farm output (for procurement at support prices) — amounted to about 1-1.2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019-20.

But, the distribution of funds was skewed towards a handful of states. For instance, central transfers and subsidies translated into an average benefit of Rs 18,000-20,000 per agricultural household, on average for the entire country. In contrast, a farm household in Punjab received about Rs 1.2-1.5 lakh — several times the national average.

The average annual transfers to farm households varied from Rs 52,000-65,000 in Haryana and Rs 29,000-32,000 in Andhra Pradesh to just Rs 14,000 in Bihar and less than Rs 7,000 in West Bengal.

In absolute terms, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh were major beneficiaries but in terms of the average transfer per household, Punjab and Haryana dwarfed other states. More so when compared to eastern states like Bihar and West Bengal.

Going by the constitutional mandate that makes agriculture a state subject, the authors suggested that states should have both the freedom and responsibility to implement schemes to incentivise and protect farmers. States could undertake procurement, crop insurance, and transfers but the union government would not finance these.

“In the longer run, the aim should be to restrict the role of the union government to finance better nutrition (by continuing with food subsidies for consumers) without distorting agriculture and production choices,” the paper noted.

Also Read: What’s fortified rice, why is Modi govt pushing it & why some experts aren’t excited

Credit wars

The authors admitted that globally as well as in India, “withdrawing entitlements is fiendishly difficult” and Indian politics has increasingly become susceptible to “attribution stakes” — that is, politicians wanting to take credit for schemes they roll out and the benefits that flow from them.

“Even the manner in which PM-Kisan (direct cash assistance to farmers) came about — as the union government’s response to direct transfers schemes in agriculture by Telangana and Odisha— reflected the fear that credit for helping farmers would be appropriated by state governments,” the authors wrote.

Similarly, an anxious West Bengal refused to implement PM-Kisan to not let the Centre take credit for helping farmers. “The attribution stakes are caught in this ever-expanding cycle.”

The paper said that “agriculture is stuck in a bad status quo but one that is a sort of political equilibrium… it will require a big dose of cooperative federalism… with transitional assistance for states as subsidies and transfers are gradually withdrawn.”

The authors further stated that states need to experiment with reforms and also put their money where their mouth is. For instance, West Bengal’s recent budget saw a sharp fall in capital outlays on agriculture which “illustrates the forked tongue with which states have treated agriculture”.

Punjab, the paper noted, is a “rare and tragic example of agricultural success not facilitating broader structural transformation, in part because of the large subsidies from the union that have tended to entrench the inefficient status quo. One could say Punjab has been afflicted by a kind of aid curse.”

Hyderabad: Several Iron Age monuments, popularly known as megalithic burials dating back 1000 BC (3,000 years old) are found endangered at Varadarajapuram in Siddipet and Kesavaram Thanda in Medchal district.

Archaeologist E Sivanagi Reddy examined the near extinct Iron Age burials located on the outskirts of Varadarajapuram in Markook mandal, Siddipet district and Kesavaram Thanda in Muduchintalapalli mandal in Medchal District after he was informed about them by Kotha Telangana Charitra Brundam members, including A. Karunakar, Md. Nasaruddin and K Gopal.

After his examination, the archaeologist said until a few years ago there were quite a few megalithic burials formed of huge boulders in circular plan and planted with huge stones in front of them at Varadarajapuram. They were known as Menhirs. Unfortunately, now only one was noticed and that too in a bad position on ground.

Similarly, another Iron Age site at Kesavaram Thanda in Medchal District, where the funerary monuments spread on either side of the road was vanishing due to execution of different works. This was erasing the proto-historic evidence of the place, he explained.

At both the locations, Sivanagi Reddy sensitized local farmers in whose agricultural lands these monuments noticed, about the archaeological significance and appealed to preserve them for posterity.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Iron-age-3.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/iron-age-monuments-neglected-in-siddipet-medchal

The Rebari pastoral community undertakes large-scale migration to various parts of Gujarat and other states to graze their animals

The opening up of India’s first camel dairy at Nakhatrana taluka in Gujarat’s Kutch district in 2018 helped Mura Mangal resume pastoralism.

“In 2006, we had some goats, but it was getting difficult to earn enough money. So I took up a driving job to feed my family. But I hated it and it was taking a toll on my health. When the dairy was set up, I took the decision to buy three camels,” Mangal, who belongs to the Rebari pastoral community, found in scattered colonies across Gujarat and Rajasthan, said.

In the past four years, Mangal has increased his camel stock to 50 and today earns Rs 60,000 a month from selling camel milk to the dairy. He was earning Rs 8,000 a month as a truck driver.

Mangal said the utility of camels had reduced substantially after tempos reached the village. This is the reason, most of the community shifted to other livestock or quit pastorialism altogether.

The decision to set up Sarahad cooperative dairy has for the first time created a sustained demand for camel milk. But this transition has not been easy.

Dairies were initially hesitant because there are scheduling issues with the pastoralists. Also, they were not sure if the milk would meet the hygiene standards, said Ramesh Bhatti, programme director of the Centre for Pastoralism (CfP), run by Kutch-based non-profit Sahjeevan.

So, the non-profit, almost a decade ago, teamed up with the National Dairy Development Board in Gujarat and started procuring buffalo, cow and goat milk for pastoralists and supplied it to different dairies to establish the credibility of the community. And it worked.

In the past two years, at least 22 youngsters have returned to their villages and bought camels, Vasant Saberwal from CfP said. One of them is 18-year-old Jayesh Rabari, who left Bhuk Sanosura village in 2016 to study and eventually work elsewhere.

He returned during the COVID-19 pandemic and is now happily settled in his village. “I left because there was no future in pastoralism. But it has now become profitable. My family is earning Rs 80,000 a month by selling camel milk,” Jayesh said.

Today, dairies across Kutch receive 0.7 million litres of buffalo milk every day from 47,000 pastoralist families. Also, Sarhad dairy has gainfully employed 190 pastoral families, who supply 3,500-4,000 litres of camel milk every day.

“In the last 10 years, the milk economy from Kutch has grown to be Rs 200 crore,” Bhatt said.

Pastoralism is one of the oldest and most sustainable food systems on the planet where herders, along with livestock, move from one climatic region to another every year in search of food, to take advantage of suitable pastures and grasslands, and to avoid extreme temperatures.

Experts say that globally, lands sustained by pastoralism form the largest carbon sink. Grazing of the pastures by herbivores stimulates regrowth of plants.

Very often, these routes are the only places in the landscape where you have natural vegetation, Francisco Martin Azcarate, professor, Autonomous University of Madrid, said.

While grazing, the animals disperse seeds through their dung. It also helps in preventing wildfires as grazing consumes ground level vegetation, he added. The lands where pastoralists move cover over half of the world’s earth surface and are thus the largest ecosystem, according to the UN.

Pastoralists are also the creators and guardians of different livestock varieties, carefully breeding animals with specific traits such as the ability to survive in drought-like conditions or walk long distances.

“The Raikar Rabari community in Rajasthan breeds Nari cattle which are reared only in the Aravalli hill range; in Telangana, the Lambada community breed the Poda Thurupu cattle which are able to survive the hot climate,” Bhatti said.

Of the 202 livestock breeds recognised by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in Karnal, Haryana, 73 are reared and preserved by pastoralists.

Positive change

India has a significant population of pastoralists. There are no official numbers, but according to organisations working with the communities, about 20 million pastoralists graze the country’s forests and grasslands.

Over the past few years, there has been a positive shift in the way pastoralism is being discussed in India, with the Central and the state governments becoming more responsive in their needs.

The change started in 2019, with the setting up of the Union Ministry for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying and the shifting of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying under it. The new ministry is setting up a dedicated cell to oversee the well-being of pastoral communities.

“Till now, pastoralism is not being recognised the way it should be. Sadly, we don’t even know the population of pastoralists in the country, their economy, the challenges they face, the impact they face due to climate change or their contribution to the country’s GDP. The cell will be formed soon and it work towards this,” Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Parshottam Rupala told Down to Earth.

In the formal institutions, the belief is that livestock management is done better in stable conditions, and pastoralists are looked down upon. This is definitely changing, said DK Sadana, former head of the animal genetic resources at NBAGR.

On August 23, 2022, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying wrote to states with sizeable pastoral populations to focus government schemes on the welfare of pastoral communities.

The letter asks 12 state animal husbandry departments (in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh) to provide assistance to pastoralists under the National Livestock Mission, the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund and the Rashtriya Gokul Mission.

Until now, the schemes pertaining to livestock were mostly geared toward farmers and the settled population of animal keepers. It says that the states may develop extension activities suitable for awareness generation in the pastoralist community and can avail Central assistance.

“Currently, we have no schemes for pastoralists. There are schemes for livestock and animal husbandry, but those are applied to the settled animal keepers and not the pastoral community, which is mostly included in schemes by the social welfare department,” Rupala said.

This is a significant shift in the government’s stance on pastoralists. A 2003 study by the Centre for Management in Agriculture, the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, the League for Pastoral Peoples, Germany, and the University of Greenwich, UK, mentions how the then Union Ministry of Agriculture and the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest have ignored the pastoral system altogether, even as mainstream society sees pastoralism as an outmoded way of life.

Change is also taking place at the state level and non-profits are playing a crucial role in the same. In 2010, Sahjeevan ensured the registration of the Banni buffalo and Kharai camel breeds with NBAGR.

Following this, the Gujarat government in 2012 commissioned the organisation to identify and characterise all pastoral breeds and register them. The work was completed in 2020, with nine new breeds of camel, goat, donkey, sheep, and horses being identified and registered.

In Bikaner, Rajasthan, non-profit Urmul Trust has built resting spaces and water structures along the pasture routes. Till date, 15 new water reservoirs have been constructed and one has been revived along the routes in four villages, in collaboration with gram panchayats.

CfP has embarked on a project to produce an atlas on Indian pastoralism to capture its scale and spread across the country. The idea is to map the traditional grazing routes across states.

“While doing the surveys in Himachal Pradesh (the pilot state), we found that at some point or another, pastoralists move in the entire state. It is remarkable visually and a powerful way of making a point. They are present throughout the state. We expect to develop the atlas over the next year and a half,” said Saberwal. The next states to be covered are Uttarakhand and Gujarat.

Global push

Like India, there is a growing recognition of the need for sustainable rangelands and pastoralism. The UN General Assembly this March declared 2026 the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists.

This happened after two years of deliberation and support from 60 countries worldwide.

“From South Asia, India, Bhutan and Afghanistan supported the resolution. We are hoping to see some active measures to support pastoralism in the run-up to the year as all countries that have supported the resolution have to focus their attention towards the pastoral system,” said Sadana, who facilitated the Regional International Steering Group for South Asia at the Assembly. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the Dana Declaration on Mobile Peoples and Conservation.

In May, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a handbook detailing guidelines for developing national legal and policy frameworks for pastoral mobility.

It calls for legal recognition of pastoralists’ right to move with their livestock within and across national borders, without hindrance for purposes of obtaining access to pastures, water, and other strategic livestock husbandry resources.

The report also touches upon the importance of pastoralism in the achievement of livestock-related Sustainable Development Goals. One of the goals requires countries to report on indigenous animals. Governments must use this to support its pastoral communities who play a cricual role in their preservation, saids Natasha Maru, editor of the FAO handbook.

In 2019, based on an application by Austria, Greece, and Italy, UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage included the seasonal droving of livestock along migratory routes in the Mediterranean and the Alps on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2019.

Drove roads are routes used by pastoralists to transport livestock herds by foot from one location to another. European countries are also working towards supporting their pastoral communities.

Spain is running the Life Cañadas project to carry out conservation and ecological restoration of the 125-km-long drove road network in the country. Though legally protected under a 1995 act, they are heavily encroached upon.

Abandonment of drove roads started in the beginning of the 20th century when most sheep started to use trains or trucks to move between summer and winter grasslands. Today, sheep have stopped migration and are fed artificial food.

“A lot of this network is not functional and it is impossible for the animals to use it. We want to move to the transhumance model, which was very similar to what used to happen hundreds of years ago in Europe but is now extinct,” said Azcarate.

He adds similar small-scale projects are happening in other parts of Europe, like Greece and Italy.

(ANI)

The state assembly will adopt a resolution to this effect during the last day of the monsoon session on Tuesday, KCR announced while participating in the discussion on proposed power sector reforms.

“I request Prime Minister Narendra Modi to withdraw the latest legislation on electricity reforms, which are detrimental to the families below the poverty line and farmers. It is better the Centre gracefully withdraw the bill before the people revolt,” he said.

The chief minister recalled that the Prime Minister had earlier introduced controversial agriculture laws and later withdrawn the same after strong protests from farmers, before apologising to the people.

Stating that the country would plunge into darkness with the lopsided power policies of the Centre, the CM alleged that the Modi government had failed to make optimum utilisation of the available power.

He said the total installed capacity of the power plants in the country is 404,000 lakh megawatts, with a base load (firm power) of 242,000 MW. However, the country recorded highest peak load of 210,000 MW on June 22 this year.

“This is less than our base load. Apart from optimum utilisation of the base load, we can immediately use at least 1.65 lakh MW in addition,” he said.

KCR said the per capita power consumption in Telangana, at the time of its formation in June 2014, was 970 units and it had gone up to 2,126 units in 2022. “However, the national per capita power consumption has increased from 957 units in 2014 to 1,255 units in 2022,” he pointed out. “Let the Centre deny my statistics. I am ready to resign my post,” he challenged.

Alleging that the Centre is trying to hand over the power sector to big corporates, the chief minister strongly objected to the Centre passing several bills in Parliament on subjects like power which are in the concurrent list, without consulting the states.

He alleged that the Centre was trying to stop granting of loans by the Rural Electrification Corporation to Telangana in the name of power sector reforms. “Telangana is a land of valour and has a history of waging prolonged battles. We are not afraid of your threats. We shall expose the Centre’s double game,” he warned.

KCR found fault with the Centre for bringing pressure on states to purchase 10% of coal from abroad. “Why should we buy coal for ₹30,000 per tonne, when we are getting it from our Singareni coal mines for just ₹4,000 per tonne?” he asked.

The chief minister reiterated his allegation that the Centre was insisting on installation of meters to the agriculture pump sets. He read out the latest gazette published by the Centre insisting that “no connections shall be given without a meter and such a meter shall be smart prepayment meter.”

KCR feared that upon implementation of the bill, 9.8 million families will be affected in Telangana. He said that not just agriculture, people are mandated to fix a smart prepayment meter to obtain any power connection. “Farmers, Dalits, tribals, laundries and salons, poultry, textiles, MSMEs and all those who are getting subsidised power will get affected.” .

Reacting to KCR’s statements, Telangana BJP president Bandi Sanjay accused the chief minister of misleading the state assembly on electricity meters to agriculture pump sets. “He has produced some outdated papers in the assembly. Let him show the provision in the new electricity bill. ” Sanjay said

The chief minister accused the Centre of selling all public sector undertakings – including railways and Life Insurance Corporation, among others -- to his corporate cronies in the name of reforms. “Now, the Modi government has set its eyes on the power sector. It is trying to hand over the crores of rupees of assets owned by the power companies to the corporate companies,” he said.

Describing Modi’s “Make-In-India” campaign as mere hoax, KCR pointed out that India was importing everything – including flags, firecrackers and even kite “manja” -- from China. “India has plunged into a big crisis due to the irresponsible and mindless policies. The youths of this country are seething with anger. They will teach a fitting lesson to the BJP at an appropriate time,” he said.

Stating that the vote share of the BJP had never crossed 50 per cent, he alleged that the Centre had pulled down as many as 11 governments so far and was misusing Central agencies to target the opponents and harassing the constitutionally-elected governments by misusing Constitutional institutions

He suggested that the electricity employees realise the conspiracy and fight against the Centre failing which they would lose their jobs as the Centre is inclined to privatise the power companies.

Reacting strongly to the recent letter written by the Centre to Telangana, asking it to repay ₹ 6,700 crore to Andhra Pradesh towards power purchase dues, KCR claimed that it was Andhra Pradesh which owed ₹17,828 crore towards electricity dues to Telangana. He demanded the Centre make Andhra Pradesh pay his state the remaining dues.

Telangana Farmers have successfully completed an experiment with the high-density planting system (HDPS), which promises to increase cotton yields by 30 to 50 percent to overcome stagnation and improve yields.
Sprays are used to control the plant's height, ensuring the crop's uniform height and making it easier for machines to harvest.
It may also take some time before more farmers switch to HDPS cotton.
""Based on farmer inquiries for planters and increased yields, we anticipate that more farmers will switch to HDPS cotton next year,"" Jagadeeshwar said.","Farmers planted 21,000-22,000 plants per acre, compared to 7,000-8,000 plants per acre previously. Sprays are used to control plant height, ensuring uniform crop height and making harvesting easier for machines.

Telangana Farmers have successfully completed an experiment with the high-density planting system (HDPS), which promises to increase cotton yields by 30 to 50 percent to overcome stagnation and improve yields.

Scientists from Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU) and the State Agricultural Ministry have conducted HDPS demonstrations in farmers' fields across 26 districts in Telangana, covering approximately 3,642 hectares.

According to one scientist, it's the equivalent of growing three acres of cotton on one acre. Unlike traditional cotton, which farmers continue to pick for 3 to 4 pickings, the HDPS crop yields all of the output in just one picking, allowing farmers to plant a short-term crop before the regular Rabi crop.

Farmers planted approximately 21,000-22,000 plants per acre, as opposed to 7,000-8,000 plants in an acre. Sprays are used to control the plant's height, ensuring the crop's uniform height and making it easier for machines to harvest.

""We planned to grow cotton on approximately 8,093 hectares in various demonstration plots across 26 districts."" This Kharif, we could grow it on nearly 9,000 acres,"" said R Jagadeeshwar, Director of Research at Prof. Jayashankar Telangana State Agricultural University (PJTSAU). He claimed that farmers have recorded 8 to 12 quintals per acre in the HDPS system as opposed to 6 to 8 quintals in the conventional system, indicating a promising start for the new cropping method.

The experiment, however, was harmed early in the Kharif season when heavy rains for nearly two and a half months hampered crop growth. ""However, after the rains stopped in August, the crop recovered."" He stated, ""They sprayed plant growth regulator (mepiquat chloride) twice."" As part of the experiment, farmers were given pneumatic planters, which reduce labour and improve precision in sowing.

The scientists chose a few varieties from Nuziveedu Seeds Limited and Rasi Seeds for the demonstration. The HDPS, on the other hand, would entail additional costs. Farmers would have to use 5-6 packets instead of two packets for an acre to grow more plants.

The planter is estimated to cost 11 lakh, while the harvester will cost 70 lakh. It may also take some time before more farmers switch to HDPS cotton.

HYDERABAD: Highlighting the importance of innovation and policies in strengthening the startup culture in India, Col. Anurag Awasthi, Vice President, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association & Interim CEO, Electropreneur Park Delhi, on Thursday, moderated the plenary session on “ Policy and Innovation” on the second day of the Public Policy Dialogues being held at ISB Hyderabad campus.

Speaking at the plenary session, Dr Sapna Poti, Director, Strategic Alliance Division, Office of Principal Scientific Advisor, Government of India, said, “The startup culture in India is a mix of good and bad eggs. On one hand, a substantial number of startups are generating massive employment opportunities, on the other hand, there are some fly-by-night startups which disappear after initial rounds of funding.”

“There is still a greater need to have quality incubators in the country to mentor startups for innovation”, she added.

Dr Vijaya Lakshmi Nadendla, Joint Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, GOI, spoke on the importance of innovation in agriculture and how technology is driving agriculture forward.

She said, “Technology has been leading every aspect of agriculture. Right from high-quality seeds to sowing technologies, irrigation, harvesting, storage, and post-harvesting, technology is the catalyst in completing the value chain in agriculture”.

Highlighting the need to bridge the linguistic gaps, accessibility of funds, between policy implementors and innovators at the grassroots level, Dr. Anamika Dey, CEO, Gujarat Grassroots Innovation Augmentation Network (GIAN), said, “Many times the innovations at the grassroots level do not see the light of the day as there are linguistic barriers. Vernacular languages are extremely crucial in promoting startup culture among grassroots level innovators. The innovators at the grassroots level are often less educated and have minimum awareness levels. There is a need for policymakers, and corporates to bridge this gap and work towards generating awareness amongst the grassroots level innovators about funding ecosystem as well at various stages of innovation”.

Mr. Bharat Lal, Director General, National Centre for Good Governance (NCCG), shared anecdotes from his journey as a policymaker and highlighted the importance of policy-making process and how effective governance plays an essential part in policy making and implementing process.

A roundtable was also organised by the India Data Portal (IDP), an initiative of BIPP- ISB to make open data easily accessible to all. Prof. Ashwini Chhatre, Executive Director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, said, “The pandemic inadvertently showed the power of collaborative work to make data not just usable but useful too. In the post-pandemic era, it is critically important to pick up conversations among multiple stakeholders in the context of data”.

The session focused on the critical need and importance of the knowledge and skillset to know what data is worth extracting and what is not, given the huge volume of data being produced. The experts also dwelled on the initiatives being taken up by the government in the form of open data portals to meet the growing demand for usable data. Domains experts from think tanks, academics, researchers and policymakers also discussed the challenges such as lack of a central portal for accessing data, standard naming format and the issues faced in comparing data across diverse datasets.

Earlier, Ms. Smita Parkash, Editor-In-Chief, Asian News International (ANI), spoke during the session on the “Role of Media in Governance & Public Policy”. She said that the media could be a positive tool in influencing public policy instead of being a silent spectator and can instead be an active participant in the policy making deliberations by bridging the communication gaps between the policymakers, researchers, and citizens.

An Innovation Sandbox video presentation session also took place with five selected proposals. The sandbox presentations covered varied subjects such as responsible migration, climate smart agriculture, sustainability, rational use and reduction of wastage of medical oxygen during the second COVID-19 scheme and the national pension scheme.",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-e3nrov7s2ui933n9vnuvr9m6e2-20230105202057.Medi.jpeg,[],https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/050123/importance-of-innovation-incubators-in-indias-startup-culture-highli.html

Keeping in mind the corruption and mismanagement of government officials, in 2013, the Government of India came forward with the DBT scheme, which stands for Direct Benefit Transfer.
As the DBT schemes mainly benefit the land-holding farmers, the situation of tenants remains the same in the country.
• Rythu Bandhu schemes: Agriculture Investment Support Scheme or Rythu Bandhu Scheme is initiated by the Government of Telangana to support the agriculture and horticulture crops.
Although DBT schemes benefit land-holding farmers, the tenants are away from it.","There exist several Agricultural/farm subsidies in India that the Indian government provides to land-holding farmers. These subsidies are provided for inputs like fertilizers, power, and water and outputs like procuring crops at market price. By getting subsidies from the government, farmers can invest in irrigation equipment, get lower rates of cost of electricity, etc.

Earlier, the subsidy amount was provided to the farmers through various mediums, and due to this, there were times when the farmers were not able to get good benefits from it. Keeping in mind the corruption and mismanagement of government officials, in 2013, the Government of India came forward with the DBT scheme, which stands for Direct Benefit Transfer. Through this scheme, the amount is transferred from the government directly to the farmers’ bank accounts.

DBT stands as a transparent and simplest way of administration. At a place where only rice, wheat and sugarcane farmers can get the MSPs (Minimum Support Price), DBT is crop-neutral and is provided to every farmer. Even though DBT is benefiting several farmers, it still has its limitations. In India, there is a rise in the number of tenant farmers. These are the farmers who don’t own land themselves. Instead, they take land for lease from the landowners and continue cultivation.

The tenancy rate is also increasing because the agreements are mostly done orally without any agreements. As the DBT schemes mainly benefit the land-holding farmers, the situation of tenants remains the same in the country. Landowners are no longer directly cultivating their lands, and the tenants are behind in getting income support and are even excluded from other agri-related schemes.

There are various DBT schemes launched by national as well as state governments of India, such as:

• PM-Kisan Scheme: The Centre’s Pradhan Mantri Kisan Samman Nidhi Yojana or PM-Kisan scheme is a 100% centrally funded scheme of India which came into operation on 1 December 2018. Under this scheme, an income support amount of 6,000/- is provided to the land-holding farmers annually. Which farmer is eligible to get the support is decided by the State Government and UT administration considering the scheme guidelines.

• Rythu Bandhu schemes: Agriculture Investment Support Scheme or Rythu Bandhu Scheme is initiated by the Government of Telangana to support the agriculture and horticulture crops. Under this scheme grant of rupees 5,000/- is made per acre of land each season. This scheme is initiated to prevent the farmers from getting into Dept Trap.

• Rythu Bharosa: The YSR Rythu Bharosa scheme was launched by the CM of Andhra Pradesh. This scheme was launched in association with the PM-Kisan Scheme, under which a total sum of Rs 13,500/- is deposited annually in the account of farmers.

Although DBT schemes benefit land-holding farmers, the tenants are away from it. There is a requirement for modification in the scheme to provide support to the person in need.",https://www.mapsofindia.com/ci-moi-images/my-india/2022/12/IMG-20221206-WA0001.jpg,[],https://www.mapsofindia.com/my-india/government/what-are-the-direct-benefit-transfers-dbt-schemes-for-tenant-farmers

Hyderabad: The State government is promoting high density cotton cultivation in about 20,000 acres in Telangana from this Vaanakalam (Kharif) season on a pilot basis. Based on the results, this highly profitable method will be increased to cover wider area from next Vaanakalam season.

Agriculture Minister S Niranjan Reddy, who is on a tour of the US, visited the Bayer Cotton Seed, Crop and Genetic Research Station at St Louis. He was accompanied by MLAs Methuku Anand, Ravindra Naik, Peddi Sudharshan Reddy and Telangana State Seeds Development Corporation managing director K Keshavulu, among others.

In a statement, Niranjan Reddy said the US had adopted modern methods using farm mechanisation for cotton cultivation on a large scale. The high density cultivation method was yielding good results and higher yield in the US which can be adopted in Telangana. “India is the leader in cotton production in the world with 6.2 million tonnes of production every year. Adopting new technologies, Telangana can become the largest cotton producer in the country and also cement the nation’s position,” he said.

The Minister said farm mechanisation would not only reduce input costs, but also increase yield and overcome labour shortage. Maharashtra is the largest producer of cotton in the country, followed by Telangana. The representatives of Bayer Group offered to supply new seed varieties pertaining to crops like cotton, maize and vegetables, he said.",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Niranjan-Reddy-55.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/telangana-govt-to-promote-high-density-cotton-cultivation

States could undertake procurement, crop insurance, and transfers but the union government would not finance these.","New Delhi: A handful of states in northern India corner most of the central subsidies and transfers to farmers, finds a new paper co-authored by former chief economic advisor Arvind Subramanian.

Titled ‘Agricultural Federalism: New Facts, Constitutional Vision’, the paper, published in Economic and Political Weekly on 3 September proposes a radical reform agenda, including putting states in charge of agriculture.

The study argues that state governments should provide tailored incentives and subsidies to their farmers while the central government should focus on research and risk mitigation to deal with adverse climate events.

The study also mentions “attribution stakes” — or credit wars over government schemes — as another affliction assailing Indian agriculture.

Besides Subramanian, the paper was co-authored by Shoumitro Chatterjee, Devesh Kapur, and Pradyut Sekhsaria.

The study found that central subsidies and transfers on five different heads — procurement from farmers at support prices, fertiliser subsidies, direct income transfers, cost of maintaining food stocks, and payments towards states taxes on farm output (for procurement at support prices) — amounted to about 1-1.2 per cent of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2019-20.

But, the distribution of funds was skewed towards a handful of states. For instance, central transfers and subsidies translated into an average benefit of Rs 18,000-20,000 per agricultural household, on average for the entire country. In contrast, a farm household in Punjab received about Rs 1.2-1.5 lakh — several times the national average.

The average annual transfers to farm households varied from Rs 52,000-65,000 in Haryana and Rs 29,000-32,000 in Andhra Pradesh to just Rs 14,000 in Bihar and less than Rs 7,000 in West Bengal.

In absolute terms, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh were major beneficiaries but in terms of the average transfer per household, Punjab and Haryana dwarfed other states. More so when compared to eastern states like Bihar and West Bengal.

Going by the constitutional mandate that makes agriculture a state subject, the authors suggested that states should have both the freedom and responsibility to implement schemes to incentivise and protect farmers. States could undertake procurement, crop insurance, and transfers but the union government would not finance these.

“In the longer run, the aim should be to restrict the role of the union government to finance better nutrition (by continuing with food subsidies for consumers) without distorting agriculture and production choices,” the paper noted.

Credit wars

The authors admitted that globally as well as in India, “withdrawing entitlements is fiendishly difficult” and Indian politics has increasingly become susceptible to “attribution stakes” — that is, politicians wanting to take credit for schemes they roll out and the benefits that flow from them.

“Even the manner in which PM-Kisan (direct cash assistance to farmers) came about — as the union government’s response to direct transfers schemes in agriculture by Telangana and Odisha— reflected the fear that credit for helping farmers would be appropriated by state governments,” the authors wrote.

Similarly, an anxious West Bengal refused to implement PM-Kisan to not let the Centre take credit for helping farmers. “The attribution stakes are caught in this ever-expanding cycle.”

The paper said that “agriculture is stuck in a bad status quo but one that is a sort of political equilibrium… it will require a big dose of cooperative federalism… with transitional assistance for states as subsidies and transfers are gradually withdrawn.”

The authors further stated that states need to experiment with reforms and also put their money where their mouth is. For instance, West Bengal’s recent budget saw a sharp fall in capital outlays on agriculture which “illustrates the forked tongue with which states have treated agriculture”.

Punjab, the paper noted, is a “rare and tragic example of agricultural success not facilitating broader structural transformation, in part because of the large subsidies from the union that have tended to entrench the inefficient status quo. One could say Punjab has been afflicted by a kind of aid curse.”

The Rebari pastoral community undertakes large-scale migration to various parts of Gujarat and other states to graze their animals

The opening up of India’s first camel dairy at Nakhatrana taluka in Gujarat’s Kutch district in 2018 helped Mura Mangal resume pastoralism.

“In 2006, we had some goats, but it was getting difficult to earn enough money. So I took up a driving job to feed my family. But I hated it and it was taking a toll on my health. When the dairy was set up, I took the decision to buy three camels,” Mangal, who belongs to the Rebari pastoral community, found in scattered colonies across Gujarat and Rajasthan, said.

In the past four years, Mangal has increased his camel stock to 50 and today earns Rs 60,000 a month from selling camel milk to the dairy. He was earning Rs 8,000 a month as a truck driver.

Mangal said the utility of camels had reduced substantially after tempos reached the village. This is the reason, most of the community shifted to other livestock or quit pastorialism altogether.

The decision to set up Sarahad cooperative dairy has for the first time created a sustained demand for camel milk. But this transition has not been easy.

Dairies were initially hesitant because there are scheduling issues with the pastoralists. Also, they were not sure if the milk would meet the hygiene standards, said Ramesh Bhatti, programme director of the Centre for Pastoralism (CfP), run by Kutch-based non-profit Sahjeevan.

So, the non-profit, almost a decade ago, teamed up with the National Dairy Development Board in Gujarat and started procuring buffalo, cow and goat milk for pastoralists and supplied it to different dairies to establish the credibility of the community. And it worked.

In the past two years, at least 22 youngsters have returned to their villages and bought camels, Vasant Saberwal from CfP said. One of them is 18-year-old Jayesh Rabari, who left Bhuk Sanosura village in 2016 to study and eventually work elsewhere.

He returned during the COVID-19 pandemic and is now happily settled in his village. “I left because there was no future in pastoralism. But it has now become profitable. My family is earning Rs 80,000 a month by selling camel milk,” Jayesh said.

Today, dairies across Kutch receive 0.7 million litres of buffalo milk every day from 47,000 pastoralist families. Also, Sarhad dairy has gainfully employed 190 pastoral families, who supply 3,500-4,000 litres of camel milk every day.

“In the last 10 years, the milk economy from Kutch has grown to be Rs 200 crore,” Bhatt said.

Pastoralism is one of the oldest and most sustainable food systems on the planet where herders, along with livestock, move from one climatic region to another every year in search of food, to take advantage of suitable pastures and grasslands, and to avoid extreme temperatures.

Experts say that globally, lands sustained by pastoralism form the largest carbon sink. Grazing of the pastures by herbivores stimulates regrowth of plants.

Very often, these routes are the only places in the landscape where you have natural vegetation, Francisco Martin Azcarate, professor, Autonomous University of Madrid, said.

While grazing, the animals disperse seeds through their dung. It also helps in preventing wildfires as grazing consumes ground level vegetation, he added. The lands where pastoralists move cover over half of the world’s earth surface and are thus the largest ecosystem, according to the UN.

Pastoralists are also the creators and guardians of different livestock varieties, carefully breeding animals with specific traits such as the ability to survive in drought-like conditions or walk long distances.

“The Raikar Rabari community in Rajasthan breeds Nari cattle which are reared only in the Aravalli hill range; in Telangana, the Lambada community breed the Poda Thurupu cattle which are able to survive the hot climate,” Bhatti said.

Of the 202 livestock breeds recognised by the National Bureau of Animal Genetic Resources (NBAGR) in Karnal, Haryana, 73 are reared and preserved by pastoralists.

Positive change

India has a significant population of pastoralists. There are no official numbers, but according to organisations working with the communities, about 20 million pastoralists graze the country’s forests and grasslands.

Over the past few years, there has been a positive shift in the way pastoralism is being discussed in India, with the Central and the state governments becoming more responsive in their needs.

The change started in 2019, with the setting up of the Union Ministry for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying and the shifting of the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying under it. The new ministry is setting up a dedicated cell to oversee the well-being of pastoral communities.

“Till now, pastoralism is not being recognised the way it should be. Sadly, we don’t even know the population of pastoralists in the country, their economy, the challenges they face, the impact they face due to climate change or their contribution to the country’s GDP. The cell will be formed soon and it work towards this,” Union Minister for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying, Parshottam Rupala told Down to Earth.

In the formal institutions, the belief is that livestock management is done better in stable conditions, and pastoralists are looked down upon. This is definitely changing, said DK Sadana, former head of the animal genetic resources at NBAGR.

On August 23, 2022, the Department of Animal Husbandry and Dairying wrote to states with sizeable pastoral populations to focus government schemes on the welfare of pastoral communities.

The letter asks 12 state animal husbandry departments (in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Karnataka, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Ladakh, Uttar Pradesh, Sikkim, Jammu and Kashmir and Arunachal Pradesh) to provide assistance to pastoralists under the National Livestock Mission, the Animal Husbandry Infrastructure Development Fund and the Rashtriya Gokul Mission.

Until now, the schemes pertaining to livestock were mostly geared toward farmers and the settled population of animal keepers. It says that the states may develop extension activities suitable for awareness generation in the pastoralist community and can avail Central assistance.

“Currently, we have no schemes for pastoralists. There are schemes for livestock and animal husbandry, but those are applied to the settled animal keepers and not the pastoral community, which is mostly included in schemes by the social welfare department,” Rupala said.

This is a significant shift in the government’s stance on pastoralists. A 2003 study by the Centre for Management in Agriculture, the Indian Institute of Management, Ahmedabad, the League for Pastoral Peoples, Germany, and the University of Greenwich, UK, mentions how the then Union Ministry of Agriculture and the Union Ministry of Environment and Forest have ignored the pastoral system altogether, even as mainstream society sees pastoralism as an outmoded way of life.

Change is also taking place at the state level and non-profits are playing a crucial role in the same. In 2010, Sahjeevan ensured the registration of the Banni buffalo and Kharai camel breeds with NBAGR.

Following this, the Gujarat government in 2012 commissioned the organisation to identify and characterise all pastoral breeds and register them. The work was completed in 2020, with nine new breeds of camel, goat, donkey, sheep, and horses being identified and registered.

In Bikaner, Rajasthan, non-profit Urmul Trust has built resting spaces and water structures along the pasture routes. Till date, 15 new water reservoirs have been constructed and one has been revived along the routes in four villages, in collaboration with gram panchayats.

CfP has embarked on a project to produce an atlas on Indian pastoralism to capture its scale and spread across the country. The idea is to map the traditional grazing routes across states.

“While doing the surveys in Himachal Pradesh (the pilot state), we found that at some point or another, pastoralists move in the entire state. It is remarkable visually and a powerful way of making a point. They are present throughout the state. We expect to develop the atlas over the next year and a half,” said Saberwal. The next states to be covered are Uttarakhand and Gujarat.

Global push

Like India, there is a growing recognition of the need for sustainable rangelands and pastoralism. The UN General Assembly this March declared 2026 the International Year of Rangelands and Pastoralists.

This happened after two years of deliberation and support from 60 countries worldwide.

“From South Asia, India, Bhutan and Afghanistan supported the resolution. We are hoping to see some active measures to support pastoralism in the run-up to the year as all countries that have supported the resolution have to focus their attention towards the pastoral system,” said Sadana, who facilitated the Regional International Steering Group for South Asia at the Assembly. This year also marks the 20th anniversary of the Dana Declaration on Mobile Peoples and Conservation.

In May, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) released a handbook detailing guidelines for developing national legal and policy frameworks for pastoral mobility.

It calls for legal recognition of pastoralists’ right to move with their livestock within and across national borders, without hindrance for purposes of obtaining access to pastures, water, and other strategic livestock husbandry resources.

The report also touches upon the importance of pastoralism in the achievement of livestock-related Sustainable Development Goals. One of the goals requires countries to report on indigenous animals. Governments must use this to support its pastoral communities who play a cricual role in their preservation, saids Natasha Maru, editor of the FAO handbook.

In 2019, based on an application by Austria, Greece, and Italy, UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Committee for the Safeguarding of the Intangible Cultural Heritage included the seasonal droving of livestock along migratory routes in the Mediterranean and the Alps on its Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2019.

Drove roads are routes used by pastoralists to transport livestock herds by foot from one location to another. European countries are also working towards supporting their pastoral communities.

Spain is running the Life Cañadas project to carry out conservation and ecological restoration of the 125-km-long drove road network in the country. Though legally protected under a 1995 act, they are heavily encroached upon.

Abandonment of drove roads started in the beginning of the 20th century when most sheep started to use trains or trucks to move between summer and winter grasslands. Today, sheep have stopped migration and are fed artificial food.

“A lot of this network is not functional and it is impossible for the animals to use it. We want to move to the transhumance model, which was very similar to what used to happen hundreds of years ago in Europe but is now extinct,” said Azcarate.

He adds similar small-scale projects are happening in other parts of Europe, like Greece and Italy.

The area was once a grazing land, where I used to spread tamarind and seeds of other plants.
A rough estimate shows about 5 crore trees, many of which have regenerated via the forest ecosystem itself,” he says.
“Considering my forest has spread across 70 acres of land and left out a few empty spaces, there are over five crore trees,” he says.","In the village of Raghavpura, located in Telangana’s Suryapet district, lies a 70-acre forest teeming with lakhs of fruit-bearing trees. Some of these are over 50 years old, and some have grown in the last three decades. The area is home to hundreds of birds and several wildlife species.

From the outside, it looks like any other forest in various parts of southern India. But take a closer look, and you’ll find many unique aspects.

For starters, the forest has no protective fence, gates, or security guards. It does not belong to the government or forest department. Instead, the entire area falls under the protection of a single guardian — Dusharla Satyanarayana.

The 68-year-old has neither bought this land, nor leased it. Instead, he has used the ancestral land that he spent his childhood in to create a thriving ecosystem.

Work of exemplary passion

“I have been creating the forest since the age of four. The area was once a grazing land, where I used to spread tamarind and seeds of other plants. It was due to my passion and love for nature from an early age that I wanted to have trees around me,” he tells The Better India.

Dusharla says he spent his childhood around many birds and animals, and formed a deep bond with the biodiversity around him. He comes from Patwari family — landlords or land accountants of the village. He says that his family owned 300 acres of land.

“The Nizams ruled the area until the late 1940s. My ancestors worked under them and had control over the vast land, which they mainly used for pasteur, irrigation, and farming purposes,” he says.

In 1948, the family became the sole owner of the land, after the Nizam-controlled region merged to become an integral part of India. As Dusharla grew older, his love for nature only grew stronger.

Over time, the family’s ownership reduced to 70 acres. This, he says, was because great-grandfather and grandfather lost most of the property. “Relatives and friends tampered with documents and seized the land. This part of land is the last bit that has remained under my possession, and continues to face similar threats,” he says.

“My father still owned 70 acres, and I started spreading seeds to generate a forest. My parents did not oppose me as they realised my positive intent to contribute to the environment. Often, my classmates or villagers entered the plantations or tried to harvest resources. I always shooed them away,” he notes.

Today, his 50 years of efforts are visible in the tall trees thriving in the forest.

In his younger days, Dusharla travelled far and wide to places across India to collect seeds and saplings of forest species. He dug a canal to harvest rainwater and channelise it to irrigate the plants, and built ponds where lotus, fish, frogs and tortoises live in abundance.

In 1980, he graduated in agriculture science, and began working as a field officer for the Union Bank of India. He spent all of his savings to create and maintain the forest.

Today, this land thrives with tree varieties such as guava, Indian jujube, cluster fig, jamun, guava, carandas plum, mango, bamboo, and others.

Dusharla says that not even a single fruit or forest resource goes out for commercial purposes or human consumption. “Everything that grows here is consumed by thousands of birds, different species of snakes, rabbits, wild boars, foxes, squirrels, monkeys, peacocks, deer, and other wildlife. What is left unconsumed decomposes and plays an important part in rejuvenating the forest. A rough estimate shows about 5 crore trees, many of which have regenerated via the forest ecosystem itself,” he says.

He explains further, “A dense tree vegetation is said to be a forest if there are adequate plant species of medicinal value, agricultural and horticultural varieties, and significant flora to maintain the biodiversity. The forest is also recognised and determined by large trunks, fruit-bearing plants, and their distribution and regeneration.”

Dusharla says that on an average, there are about 10 lakh trees per acre in the forest. “Considering my forest has spread across 70 acres of land and left out a few empty spaces, there are over five crore trees,” he says.

He adds, “The birds pollinate and spread seeds, the plants grow into trees, the wildlife contributes its bit, and the forest also plays an important role in maintaining the groundwater levels.”

No compromises for the environment

Retired IFS officer Raghuveer, in a documentary highlighting Dusharla’s efforts, says, “Dusharla is a passionate nature lover, and it is impressive to see him devoting his life to creating a forest, especially without any support from the government or private individuals. Such efforts need to be replicated and sustained. His work is an inspiration for younger generations.”

Meanwhile, Dusharla notes that while neighbouring landowners and real estate developers often try to convince him to give the land away, he is adamant about protecting it at all costs.

“I have protected the land for the past three generations. Many family members express their willingness to commercialise the land. Some have even offered Rs 100 crore. But I will not let it go for non-environmental reasons. Even my children are not heir to the land,” he says.

He also notes that it is time that humans understand the importance of environmental protection and conservation. “Humans pose a danger to the existence of forests and wildlife. Wildlife exists only because of the presence of forests. If there is no home for them, they will venture out into human settlements. Beyond maintaining the environmental balance, the forests play a crucial role in preventing human-animal conflict, and hence their survival is crucial,” he says.

HYDERABAD: Highlighting the importance of innovation and policies in strengthening the startup culture in India, Col. Anurag Awasthi, Vice President, India Electronics and Semiconductor Association & Interim CEO, Electropreneur Park Delhi, on Thursday, moderated the plenary session on “ Policy and Innovation” on the second day of the Public Policy Dialogues being held at ISB Hyderabad campus.

Speaking at the plenary session, Dr Sapna Poti, Director, Strategic Alliance Division, Office of Principal Scientific Advisor, Government of India, said, “The startup culture in India is a mix of good and bad eggs. On one hand, a substantial number of startups are generating massive employment opportunities, on the other hand, there are some fly-by-night startups which disappear after initial rounds of funding.”

“There is still a greater need to have quality incubators in the country to mentor startups for innovation”, she added.

Dr Vijaya Lakshmi Nadendla, Joint Secretary, Agriculture and Farmers Welfare Department, GOI, spoke on the importance of innovation in agriculture and how technology is driving agriculture forward.

She said, “Technology has been leading every aspect of agriculture. Right from high-quality seeds to sowing technologies, irrigation, harvesting, storage, and post-harvesting, technology is the catalyst in completing the value chain in agriculture”.

Highlighting the need to bridge the linguistic gaps, accessibility of funds, between policy implementors and innovators at the grassroots level, Dr. Anamika Dey, CEO, Gujarat Grassroots Innovation Augmentation Network (GIAN), said, “Many times the innovations at the grassroots level do not see the light of the day as there are linguistic barriers. Vernacular languages are extremely crucial in promoting startup culture among grassroots level innovators. The innovators at the grassroots level are often less educated and have minimum awareness levels. There is a need for policymakers, and corporates to bridge this gap and work towards generating awareness amongst the grassroots level innovators about funding ecosystem as well at various stages of innovation”.

Mr. Bharat Lal, Director General, National Centre for Good Governance (NCCG), shared anecdotes from his journey as a policymaker and highlighted the importance of policy-making process and how effective governance plays an essential part in policy making and implementing process.

A roundtable was also organised by the India Data Portal (IDP), an initiative of BIPP- ISB to make open data easily accessible to all. Prof. Ashwini Chhatre, Executive Director, Bharti Institute of Public Policy, said, “The pandemic inadvertently showed the power of collaborative work to make data not just usable but useful too. In the post-pandemic era, it is critically important to pick up conversations among multiple stakeholders in the context of data”.

The session focused on the critical need and importance of the knowledge and skillset to know what data is worth extracting and what is not, given the huge volume of data being produced. The experts also dwelled on the initiatives being taken up by the government in the form of open data portals to meet the growing demand for usable data. Domains experts from think tanks, academics, researchers and policymakers also discussed the challenges such as lack of a central portal for accessing data, standard naming format and the issues faced in comparing data across diverse datasets.

Earlier, Ms. Smita Parkash, Editor-In-Chief, Asian News International (ANI), spoke during the session on the “Role of Media in Governance & Public Policy”. She said that the media could be a positive tool in influencing public policy instead of being a silent spectator and can instead be an active participant in the policy making deliberations by bridging the communication gaps between the policymakers, researchers, and citizens.

An Innovation Sandbox video presentation session also took place with five selected proposals. The sandbox presentations covered varied subjects such as responsible migration, climate smart agriculture, sustainability, rational use and reduction of wastage of medical oxygen during the second COVID-19 scheme and the national pension scheme.",https://s3.ap-southeast-1.amazonaws.com/images.deccanchronicle.com/dc-Cover-e3nrov7s2ui933n9vnuvr9m6e2-20230105202057.Medi.jpeg,[],https://www.deccanchronicle.com/business/in-other-news/050123/importance-of-innovation-incubators-in-indias-startup-culture-highli.html
236,[Interview] Prabhu Pingali on the pathways to minimise tradeoffs between hunger reduction and climate mitigation,2022-05-05 06:41:34+00:00,['Aditi Tandon'],"['prabhu', 'production', 'pathways', 'practices', 'mitigation', 'climate', 'agricultural', 'hunger', 'minimise', 'reduction', 'emissions', 'pingali', 'zerocarbon', 'interview', 'food', 'system', 'tradeoffs', 'systems']","A zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system could minimise the trade-offs between hunger reduction and greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture by adopting effective climate mitigation strategies, says agricultural economist Prabhu Pingali.
Moving towards a zero-carbon food system speaks to opportunities available in the transitions including diversification of production systems.
Identifying pathways that minimise the tradeoffs between hunger reduction and climate mitigation is the central objective of our initiative,” added Pingali.
But what would a zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system look like?
There is no one model for a zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system.","A zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system could minimise the trade-offs between hunger reduction and greenhouse gas emissions in agriculture by adopting effective climate mitigation strategies, says agricultural economist Prabhu Pingali.

In an interview with Mongabay-India, Pingali discusses the opportunities and challenges associated with a zero-carbon, zero-hunger food system as India pushes for climate action and tackles its population’s well-being.

While there are ongoing experiments with zero-carbon techniques and approaches used within food systems such as solar-powered irrigation systems, and improved water management systems for rice cultivation, there is a lack of a state or national-level approach.

Progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals on hunger reduction — without any change in current food production practices — will hinder India’s efforts to eliminate greenhouse gas emissions and hold the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius, says agricultural economist Prabhu Pingali.

“Over the past half a century, rising food-grain productivity in India has resulted in major progress in hunger reduction, at least in terms of calorie sufficiency. Staple grain-centric agricultural policies, especially price supports and input subsidies, contributed to the quantum leap in food grain supplies. However, we also saw a rapid degradation of the environmental resource base and rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,” said Pingali, Director at Tata-Cornell Institute for Agriculture and Nutrition (TCI).

Pingali cautioned that under a business-as-usual scenario, the current push for doubling productivity will further aggravate these environmental and climate tradeoffs, but a “zero-hunger, zero-carbon” (ZHZC) food system could “explicitly minimise the trade-offs between hunger reduction and GHG emissions by adopting effective climate mitigation strategies.”

Zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system is one that pursues the goal of zero hunger through enhancing productivity growth while at the same time maintaining net-zero carbon emissions from agricultural production, processing and movement along the food value chain.

Agriculture is responsible for nearly 20% of India’s emissions, with livestock and rice cultivation its biggest contributors. Between 1990 and 2014, agricultural emissions rose 25%. Compounding its commitment to climate action by leaving forests intact and expanding plantations and land-based mitigation projects such as renewables, is India’s urgency to attend to the insidious nature of challenges of malnutrition and nutrient deficiencies.

While India has made substantial progress in hunger reduction in terms of meeting calorie requirements, its progress in reducing “hidden hunger”, that is micronutrient deficiencies, has been limited.

“As a result, we see stubbornly high levels of child stunting and wasting and high levels of anemia among adult women. At the same time, we are starting to observe rising obesity trends. Promoting food system diversity and enhancing access and affordability of nutrient-rich food for poor populations is an essential component of the strategy to address hidden hunger,” notes Pingali who has worked extensively on agriculture for nutrition for over 30 years.

“Investments in rural markets and value chain investments are crucial for enhancing the supply of diverse foods for urban and rural consumers. Also important, is an agricultural policy that shifts away from its traditional focus on staple grains to one that expands the food basket and ensures year-round supply. Finally, we need investments in clean drinking water, sanitation and other public health facilities in order to address the problem of child malnutrition and adult health,” he said.

Moving towards a zero-carbon food system speaks to opportunities available in the transitions including diversification of production systems. The rising demand for food diversity provides farmers with market-led incentives to diversify their production systems from their traditional focus on staple grains.

“Diversification out of paddy rice cultivation, in particular, could have significant climate mitigation benefits in terms of reducing methane emissions. For rice and wheat production systems there are opportunities to reduce carbon emissions through zero-tillage systems, better management of crop residues, more efficient use of fertilisers and water, and in general adopting smarter farming practices. There are also opportunities for promoting livestock husbandry and fodder management practices that are more climate-friendly,” said Pingali.

However, any climate solution that focuses exclusively on mitigation without addressing small farm adaptation to climate change will not be directly meeting the needs of marginal small farm communities. “Moreover, small farm communities need technical, financial and extension support for successfully adopting climate-friendly technologies. Marginalised agricultural communities bear the brunt of the adverse impacts of climate change. Rising temperatures adversely impact their crop yields, especially for those living in the drylands. Increased frequency of events such as floods and drought add to the riskiness of food production by small farmers on marginal lands,” he added.

India is currently in throes of a record-breaking heatwave, scorching its wheat harvest and raising concerns over the country’s offer to stem the food stock shortfall following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, even as the U.N. Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) warned in a report of 40% of the world’s land being degraded in its quest for food and natural resources and currently nearly half of the world’s land area is under agriculture.

Meanwhile, another UN report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, on climate mitigation, underscores that the Agriculture, Forestry, and Other Land Uses (AFOLU) sector which contributed to 13-21% of total greenhouse gas emissions between 2010 and 2019, offers considerable opportunities to reduce GHG emissions by a “concerted, rapid, and sustained effort by all stakeholders, from policy-makers and investors to landowners and managers.” According to the IPCC, AFOLU can provide 20% to 30% of the global mitigation needed for a 1.5 or 2°C pathway by 2050, though it cannot be a substitute for delayed action in reducing emissions in other sectors.

TCI recently launched the Zero-Hunger, Zero-Carbon Food Systems. In an initial meeting, researchers discussed evidence on climate impacts on Bihar’s agriculture and carbon emissions from current production practices in the run-up to a detailed assessment of the prospects for a ZHZC food system in Bihar, followed up by other eastern Indian states, such as Jharkhand and Odisha.

The challenge lies in making these technologies and management practices economically viable for smallholder systems, and in addressing the constraints they face in adopting more climate-resilient production systems. Examples of zero-carbon techniques and approaches used within food systems are solar-powered irrigation systems, conservation tillage systems, and improved water management systems for rice cultivation. But there are no state or national-level food systems that have achieved net-zero carbon.

“Most of these are discrete interventions that have not made a significant difference to the underlying system. There has also been limited attention to simultaneously addressing the dual goals of zero hunger and zero carbon. Identifying pathways that minimise the tradeoffs between hunger reduction and climate mitigation is the central objective of our initiative,” added Pingali.

But what would a zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system look like?

There is no one model for a zero-hunger, zero-carbon food system. “Specific interventions vary by agroecology and farming systems, including smallholder livestock systems. The common element is reducing carbon emissions by being smarter and more efficient in the choice of products produced and inputs used, especially energy, water, and fertilisers.”

“Incentives for changing production practices depend on a policy environment that encourages—or at least does not discourage—change, such as subsidy-free fertilisers, power, water and other inputs. Also important is a food price policy that does not aggravate the hunger-climate tradeoffs.”

Working with community-based organisations is one way to enable the transition is just for communities because it ensures climate-friendly agricultural technologies and practices are successfully adopted in a way that benefits smallholders.

“Farmer Producer Organisations and Women’s Self-Help Groups ought to be seen as partners in promoting zero-carbon strategies for crop and livestock production systems and value chains. Bihar, through its Jeevika program, has been a leader in popularising Women’s Self-Help Groups across the state. That’s definitely a platform that climate-smart farming can be built upon,” Pingali said.

Pingali who is also the Governing Board Chair at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), a CGIAR Research Center, also spotlighted the role of CGIAR institutions in potentially having a big impact in making Indian agriculture resilient to climate change. “ICRISAT, headquartered in Hyderabad, has a long history of working on dryland crops such as millets and sorghum. These crops can help sustain the food security of the poor populations living in arid and semi-arid regions of India. Work on drought-tolerant crops and management practices such as conservation tillage and efficient water management help farmers adapt to climate change. It is true that India has strong agricultural research institutes. ICRISAT and the CGIAR centers work in partnership with Indian institutes and are crucial conduits for bringing global knowledge and research advances for addressing the problems of Indian agriculture and food security in the face of climate change,” he added.

By integrating their automation into the farm, farmers can ensure that human errors are eliminated, and productivity is increased.
Along with this, the team has also set up several indoor vertical and polyhouse hydroponic farms for farmers across India.
“Today, people are more aware of health, the prices and acceptance for hydroponic food which is quite good.
For their work, CityGreens was awarded a Rs 65 lakh grant from the Government for their venture.","“On my Panvel farm, I tried growing cherry tomatoes using hydroponics but faced difficulties from day one,” says Siva Ramakrishnan, a farmer from Mumbai. He adds that the production was never up to the mark and in six months, the farm had to be shut down.

Following this disheartening stint at using hydroponics, the farmer got to know about a three-day training programme that was being run in Coimbatore by a venture CityGreens.

The year was 2019 and Ramakrishnan moved cities to attend the programme and eventually loved it so much that he decided to start his farming practice in Coimbatore itself. “I realised that hydroponics is a science and if you do it right it should work,” he adds.

However, life got in the way for the farmer and it was only in 2021 that he finally started farming by integrating hydroponic measures in his farm, helped by CityGreens.

The results that he observed were phenomenal. “The quarter acre farm’s harvest was more than open field farms. I started growing Indian greens here as advised by CityGreens experts, instead of lettuce which is a traditional hydroponics plant.”

Ramakrishnan was only one of the 5,000 farmers helped by CityGreens, co-founded by, Gaurav Narang.

A mission for better food

Narang, an alumnus of IIM Kolkata never imagined he would set up a venture that would one day provide Indian homes with good quality produce.

Prior to this, he worked in the pharma sector wherein he was involved in the supply chain of medicines. “We would provide speciality medicine and care services to patients suffering from chronic and life-threatening diseases like cancer, auto-immune diseases, diabetes, etc,” he says.

The correlation between the quality of food that people in cities consume and the diseases they are inflicted with was precedent enough for CityGreens to start their research.

“We realised there is a dearth of good quality vegetables on the production side, and low farm yields due to the traditional way of growing produce,” says Narang.

So, in an attempt to solve this problem, Narang says he decided to set up a venture wherein they would procure produce from different farms and then sell it. But, it wasn’t as simple.

“When I sat down to understand the market, I realised ‘organic’ doesn’t always mean ‘free of pesticides’. Simply trying to bring order to the chaos was not a solution, as the problem was of a larger scale,” he says.

This was when he began reading up about how western countries managed to get good quality produce during harvest, and stumbled upon the idea of hydroponics.

“Through further reading, I understood that this, though an attractive option, had once failed in India on its advent. I took it up as a challenge to start a venture that would ensure large-scale production of fresh, safe and healthy food for the masses, and do this through low-cost technology that we would share with farmers across the world,” he adds.

Taking this ideology forward, in 2017, Narang quit the pharma sector to start CityGreens with his wife Shwaita. The couple was joined by Rahul Indorkar, another IIM Kolkata alumnus, as a co-founder in 2020.

How does it work?

As Narang explains, the working of the venture is divided into a series of stages.

Once a farmer approaches them saying he wants to farm using hydroponics, the team at CityGreens first understands the crop in focus.

“We then conduct research and use our previous knowledge to see if the crop has a market and is viable. Many people are under the impression that hydroponics is limited only to leafy greens, but this is not true,” says Narang.

Once the crop is decided upon, the location is assessed by CityGreens experts and then climate patterns are mapped. “This helps us understand if the farmhouse should be climate controlled or naturally ventilated.”

The planning stage takes around a month. Following this, the team either sets up a polyhouse or integrates hydroponics technology on the farm and continues visiting the farmer at different times throughout the weeks to assess the performance.

“During these weeks, a dry run is conducted to check the technology, and then our agronomists visit the farmers to help them with transplantation of the vegetable saplings,” he adds.

By integrating their automation into the farm, farmers can ensure that human errors are eliminated, and productivity is increased.

Increasing efficiency of farms

CityGreens has four farms in Ahmedabad, out of which three are hydroponic and one is indoor, and another is a hydroponic farm in Bengaluru.

“The food we grow here gets supplied to companies like BigBasket. Milk Basket, Gabbar Farms, and retail stores, etc through which the food is sold to end consumers,” he says.

The IoT technology suite that they have commercialised is being used in more than 20 farms across India, and their farm in Uttarakhand started in 2021 is the first fully automated farm in India for growing medical cannabis using aeroponic technology.

Along with this, the team has also set up several indoor vertical and polyhouse hydroponic farms for farmers across India. These include cities such as Almora, Haridwar, Delhi, Ahmedabad, Baroda, Selam, Coimbatore, Hyderabad and more.

“We have set up more than 25 farms in the last couple of years,” says Narang.

Something for everyone

While their aim is to make every farm in India ‘smart’, CityGreens has ensured that through their offerings, everyone benefits.

“We provide kits, nutrients, lights, and other inputs for hobby growers,” says Rahul, adding that these kits are developed and manufactured by them. “We have more than 600 cities in India using our products to grow food for their consumption,” he adds.

He mentions that they help commercial growers in the setup of hydroponic and indoor vertical farms, including the concept, design, set-up, agronomy and sales support to the farmers for a period of 1-year post setup.

But for the three co-founders, success tastes sweeter as they began by having no knowledge about agriculture.

Working closely with farmers

“Coming from a successful entrepreneurial background and then trying to get our hands dirty by growing food ourselves was not something that was encouraged by many,” says Shwaita, adding that people did not think of farming as a respectable profession back then, especially for a woman.

However, this never stopped her or the other two founders from achieving what they had set out to.

“Today, people are more aware of health, the prices and acceptance for hydroponic food which is quite good. This ensures good profitability and income for CityGreens and also for other farmers who are early movers and adopting these technologies,” says Narang.

For their work, CityGreens was awarded a Rs 65 lakh grant from the Government for their venture.

Last year the venture saw a turnover of Rs 8 crore and the trio could not have been happier.

“Everyone is looking to work and make money to survive. But we are fortunate that we are able to do this while helping farmers and doing our bit of good in the world,” says Narang.

241,Carbon Streaming Announces Sustainable Rice Farming Stream With Core Carbonx,,[],"['information', 'streaming', 'stream', 'forwardlooking', 'farming', 'rice', 'carbonx', 'including', 'core', 'company', 'project', 'carbon', 'announces', 'sustainable']","TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Carbon Streaming Corporation (NEO: NETZ) (OTCQB: OFSTF) (FSE: M2Q) (“Carbon Streaming” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a carbon credit streaming agreement (“Nalgonda Rice Farming Stream” or the “Carbon Stream”) with Core CarbonX Solutions Pvt Ltd. and its services provider, Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited (collectively, “Core CarbonX”), to develop its Nalgonda Rice Farming methane avoidance grouped project located in the Nalgonda District, Telangana State, India (the “Project”).
Core CarbonX is expected to make its first delivery under the Carbon Stream in the second half of calendar year 2023.
Carbon Streaming Founder and CEO Justin Cochrane stated: “We are delighted to announce our first carbon stream on an agricultural project and partnership with Core CarbonX.
Carbon Streaming will also make ongoing delivery payments to Core CarbonX on the sale price for each VCU sold under the Carbon Stream, which is within the range indicated for the Company’s other carbon credit streaming agreements.
Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking InformationThis news release contains certain forward-looking statements and forward-looking information (collectively, “forward-looking information”) within the meaning of applicable securities laws.","TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Carbon Streaming Corporation (NEO: NETZ) (OTCQB: OFSTF) (FSE: M2Q) (“Carbon Streaming” or the “Company”) is pleased to announce that it has entered into a carbon credit streaming agreement (“Nalgonda Rice Farming Stream” or the “Carbon Stream”) with Core CarbonX Solutions Pvt Ltd. and its services provider, Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited (collectively, “Core CarbonX”), to develop its Nalgonda Rice Farming methane avoidance grouped project located in the Nalgonda District, Telangana State, India (the “Project”).

The Project enrolls rice farmers in a program to reduce greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by improving their rice cultivation practices and rewards participants with a portion of the proceeds received through the sale of Verified Carbon Units (“VCUs”) generated. The improved cultivation practices and resulting GHG emission reductions are achieved through implementing Alternate Wetting and Drying (“AWD”) and Direct-Seeded Rice (“DSR”) farming methods.

Streaming Agreement Highlights:

The Project is expected to generate approximately 2.5 million VCUs over seven years, in a range of approximately 300,000 to 400,000 VCUs annually, and is expected to be independently verified and registered through Verra.

Carbon Streaming will receive 100% of the VCUs generated by the Project, with ongoing payments to Core CarbonX for each VCU sold.

Core CarbonX is expected to make its first delivery under the Carbon Stream in the second half of calendar year 2023.

Carbon Streaming has made an initial upfront deposit of US$1.55 million on closing, with an additional payment of US$1.78 million as the Project achieves registration and credit issuance milestones.

With the Project focused on methane avoidance and strong co-benefits, the Company expects VCUs generated to be sold at a premium to market pricing, which has ranged from approximately US$6.50/VCU to US$9/VCU year to date.

Carbon Streaming expects payback in less than four years assuming current market pricing for agricultural methane avoidance credits.

Impact Highlights:

The Project focuses on enrolling rice farmers in a program to implement AWD rice cultivation practices and educate them on the benefits of this technique.

The AWD protocol decreases water consumption by up to 30% and allows for more oxygenation of soil, reducing anaerobic decomposition and methane emissions by up to 50%.

All emission reductions from the Project are considered methane avoidance, delivering action towards the UN Global Methane Pledge.

The Project targets six UN Sustainable Development Goals, including Climate Action (13), No Poverty (1), Zero Hunger (2), Decent Work and Economic Growth (8), Responsible Consumption and Production (12), and Partnerships for the Goals (17).

Carbon Streaming Founder and CEO Justin Cochrane stated: “We are delighted to announce our first carbon stream on an agricultural project and partnership with Core CarbonX. This stream continues to diversify our high-quality portfolio by project type and geography.”

Mr. Cochrane continued: “Core CarbonX has been collaborating with organizations and guiding clients successfully for more than a decade on climate mitigation projects and supporting communities to achieve alternative, sustainable sources of income to improve livelihoods.”

“We are excited to collaborate with our new partner, Carbon Streaming, to bring Alternate Water Management Practices (AWD and DSR) to rice fields in the Nalgonda District of Telangana State, India,” said Niroj Mohanty, Managing Director of Core CarbonX. “Carbon Streaming’s innovative climate financing allows us to leverage our considerable expertise to provide enrolled farmers with tools to farm more sustainably and reduce methane emissions.”

Core CarbonX Solutions Private Limited was established in India in 2008 as a climate and sustainability consulting firm, serving clients in more than 10 countries. It has been active in both the voluntary and compliance carbon markets, facilitating the generation of one million carbon credits from renewable energy and nature-based solutions.

For this Project, Core CarbonX is partnering with farmer producer organizations and local universities to educate farmers on the benefits of implementing the AWD and DSR methods, and to provide implementation training. The participating farmers will shift from continuously flooding the fields to the AWD method, and from the transplanting to DSR method. As part of the Project, Core CarbonX will also install field water tubes to monitor the water depth to notify farmers when to irrigate their fields. The conventional rice cultivation practice of continuous flooding requires large amounts of water and also results in methane production through anaerobic decomposition of soil. By converting to the AWD protocol, water usage is expected to decrease up to 30%, resulting in energy conservation from reduced water pumping, and GHG emissions are estimated to decrease by up to 50%.

Pursuant to the project plan, the Project expects to enroll 40,000 hectares (“ha”), with full enrollment anticipated by the end of 2022. The Project is expected to reduce approximately 2.5 million tCO 2 e emissions and generate an equivalent number of carbon credits over the seven-year term of the Carbon Stream, in a range of approximately 300,000 to 400,000 VCUs annually commencing in the second half of calendar year 2023. The Company will receive 100% of the VCUs generated by the Project and will have the option to renew the Carbon Stream for up to 14 additional years, upon mutual agreement of the parties. Emission reductions generated by the Project are expected to be independently verified and registered by Verra as Core CarbonX is currently engaging an auditor for validation.

Under the terms of the Nalgonda Rice Farming Stream, the Company has made an initial upfront deposit of US$1.55 million upon closing. The Company will make an additional milestone payment of US$1.78 million as the Project achieves various milestones, including reaching enrollment of farmers representing a total of 40,000 ha, Project verification by Verra and credit issuance. Carbon Streaming will also make ongoing delivery payments to Core CarbonX on the sale price for each VCU sold under the Carbon Stream, which is within the range indicated for the Company’s other carbon credit streaming agreements. Proceeds from the Carbon Stream are expected to be used for Project implementation and registration costs.

In partnering with Core CarbonX, the Company is mindful of the passage of the Energy Conservation (Amendment) Bill, 2022 in India, which will ban the export of certain carbon credits until the country meets its climate goals. Following significant analysis, the Company believes that this Bill pertains primarily to the renewable energy sector and is not directed at voluntary carbon credits such as those produced by the Project, which are outside of this sector.

The Company expects VCUs from the Project to be sold at a premium to typical avoidance-based credits pricing due to emission reductions being entirely from methane avoidance as well as the strong co-benefits of the Project. Pricing for other methane avoidance credits ranged from approximately US$6.50/VCU to US$9/VCU year to date. Based on these prices, the Company expects to achieve a payback on its capital investment in less than four years.

China’s shrinking population will spur a trend that already concerns demographers: a rapidly aging society.

By Telangana Today Published Date - 12:45 AM, Sat - 28 January 23

By Feng Wang

Hyderabad: Throughout much of recorded human history, China has boasted the largest population in the world – and until recently, by some margin.

So news that the Chinese population is now in decline, and will sometime later this year be surpassed by that of India, is big news even if long predicted.

As a scholar of Chinese demographics, I know that the figures released by Chinese government on January 17, showing that for the first time in six decades, deaths in the previous year outnumbered births is no mere blip.

While that previous year of shrinkage, 1961 – during the Great Leap Forward economic failure, in which an estimated 30 million people died of starvation – represented a deviation from the trend, 2022 is a pivot. It is the onset of what is likely to be a long-term decline. By the end of the century, the Chinese population is expected to shrink by 45%, according to the United Nations. And that is under the assumption that China maintains its current fertility rate of around 1.3 children per couple, which it may not.

This decline in numbers will spur a trend that already concerns demographers in China: a rapidly ageing society. By 2040, around a quarter of the Chinese population is predicted to be over the age of 65.

In short, this is a seismic shift. It will have huge symbolic and substantive impacts on China in three main areas.

Economy

In the space of 40 years, China has largely completed a historic transformation from an agrarian economy to one based on manufacturing and the service industry. This has been accompanied by increases in the standard of living and income levels. But the Chinese government has long recognised that the country can no longer rely on the labour-intensive economic growth model of the past. Technological advances and competition from countries that can provide a cheaper workforce such as Vietnam and India have rendered this old model largely obsolete.

This historical turning point in China’s population trend serves as a further wake-up call to move the country’s model more quickly to a post-manufacturing, post-industrial economy – an ageing, shrinking population does not fit the purposes of a labour-intensive economic model.

As to what it means for China’s economy, and that of the world, population decline and an ageing society will certainly provide Beijing with short-term and long-term challenges. In short, it means there will be fewer workers able to feed the economy and spur further economic growth on one side of the ledger; on the other, a growing post-work population will need potentially costly support.

It is perhaps no coincidence then that 2022, as well as being a pivotal year for China in terms of demographics, also saw one of the worst economic performances the country has experienced since 1976, according to data released on Jan 17.

Society

The rising share of elderly people in China’s population is more than an economic issue – it will also reshape Chinese society. Many of these elderly people only have one child, due to the one-child policy in place for three and a half decades before being relaxed in 2016.

The large number of ageing parents with only one child to rely on for support will likely impose severe constraints – not least for the elderly parents, who will need financial support. They will also need emotional and social support for longer as a result of extended life expectancy.

It will also impose constraints on those children themselves, who will need to fulfil obligations to their career, provide for their own children and support their elderly parents simultaneously.

Responsibility will fall on the Chinese government to provide adequate healthcare and pensions. But unlike in Western democracies that have by now had many decades to develop social safety nets, the speed of the demographic and economic change in China has meant that Beijing struggled to keep pace.

As China’s economy underwent rapid growth after 2000, the Chinese government responded by investing tremendously in education and health care facilities, as well as extending universal pension coverage. But the demographic shift was so rapid that it meant that political reforms to improve the safety net were always playing catch-up. Even with the vast expansion in coverage, the country’s health care system is still highly inefficient, unequally distributed and inadequate given the growing need.

Similarly, social pension systems are highly segmented and unequally distributed.

Politics

How the Chinese government responds to the challenges presented by this dramatic demographic shift will be key. Failure to live up to the expectations of the public in its response could result in a crisis for the Chinese Communist Party, whose legitimacy is tied closely to economic growth. Any economic decline could have severe consequences for the Chinese Communist Party. It will also be judged on how well the state is able to fix its social support system.

Indeed, there is already a strong case to be made that the Chinese government has moved too slowly. The one-child policy that played a significant role in the slowing growth, and now decline, in population was a government policy for more than three decades. It has been known since the 1990s that the Chinese fertility rate was too low to sustain current population numbers. Yet it was only in 2016 that Beijing acted and relaxed the policy to allow more couples to have a second, and then in 2021 a third, child.

This action to spur population growth, or at least slow its decline, came too late to prevent China from soon losing its crown as the world’s largest nation. Loss of prestige is one thing though, the political impact of any economic downturn resulting from a shrinking population is quite another. theconversation.com",https://cdn.telanganatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Chinese.jpg,[],https://telanganatoday.com/opinion-chinas-big-problem

The orders now allow real estate companies and other businesses to carry out construction in 84 villages in the catchment areas of the reservoirs.
“In 1908, the city saw a devastating flood, caused by the Musi river,” said Hyderabad-based environmentalist K Purushotham Reddy.
It will affect the sustainability of the city,” Reddy said.
Allowing construction activities in its catchment areas will mean summers will get hotter in the city,” Reddy said.","Telangana repeals 1996 order, allows construction on 2 reservoirs that have saved Hyderabad from floods for over a century

A sprawling photo studio for wedding shoots, educational institutions, upscale resorts, villas and farmhouses crowd the peripheries of the Osmansagar and Himayatsagar lakes on the outskirts of Hyderabad. The massive campuses have been set up despite a March 8, 1996 government order that prohibits construction or industrial activity within 10 kilometres of the century-old reservoirs.

That order was passed to keep the reservoirs pollution-free. Now Telangana has repealed the order, paving the way for concretisation of the catchment areas of the lakes.

The K Chaadrashekar Rao government issued two orders on April 12 and April 20, authorising construction around the reservoirs as long as theie water quality was not impacted. The orders also announced the formation of a committee under the state chief secretary to frame guidelines to protect and prevent pollution in the waterbodies, and submit the report at the earliest.

The orders now allow real estate companies and other businesses to carry out construction in 84 villages in the catchment areas of the reservoirs.

Building on a lie

The state government rationalises the decision by claiming that the reservoirs now provide only 1.25 per cent of Hyderabad’s drinking water, from 27.59 per cent in 1996.

Experts contest the claim, saying that the reservoirs were constructed to save Hyderabad from flooding. “In 1908, the city saw a devastating flood, caused by the Musi river,” said Hyderabad-based environmentalist K Purushotham Reddy. That is when the Nizam (ruler) of Hyderabad had requested Mokshagundam Visvesvaraya, a celebrated civil engineer and the then diwan (administrator) of the erstwhile Mysore kingdom, to make a flood control plan.

Visvesvaraya suggested constructing two reservoirs upstream of Hyderabad, one on the Musi and the other on its tributary, Esa, to absorb and store excess water during floods, says Purushotham Reddy. “The Nizam later decided to use the reservoirs to provide drinking water to the city and prohibited polluting activity in the catchment area,” he added.

Till 1975, the reservoirs were used to meet the drinking water needs of Hyderabad. As the city expanded, it started receiving water from Krishna and Godavari rivers, from over 200 km away. Even today, the two reservoirs provide 226.5 billion litres of water a day to the city. “There is no logic in destroying existing facilities. It will affect the sustainability of the city,” Reddy said.

Rajkumar Singh, an environmental activist who filed a petition with the National Green Tribunal (NGT) in 2015 to conserve the catchment areas of the two lakes, says the reservoirs have saved Hyderabad from at least six major flooding events between 1908 and early 2000s. “The concretisation started around the 2000s and the city witnessed floods in 2020 and 2021,” he added.

If the catchment area gets concretised further, the flood waters could move six times faster than normal and cause unprecedented damage, said BV Subbarao, hydrologist and technical advisor at Bangalore University, adding that the latest move is not in the interest of Telangana. The Musi river originates and ends in the state.

“Telangana has 100 per cent control over the river. It has a basin of 12,000 sq km and the catchment areas of the reservoirs account for almost 17 per cent of the river’s catchment area,” Subbarao said.

“Starting in April, wind starts to flow over the two reservoirs and it has a cooling effect on Hyderabad. Allowing construction activities in its catchment areas will mean summers will get hotter in the city,” Reddy said.

Without a thought

Telangana Chief Minister Rao said the decision would provide employment and livelihood, but the residents are sceptical. But farmers for whom agriculture is not sustainable and residents who want to sell their land but are getting low rates are in favour of this.

The real estate sharks purchased lots of land in the catchment directly. The poor sold the land at low rates as registration was not happening,” said N Saibhaskar Reddy, environmentalist and resident of Gondala village, which is in the catchment area.

Purushotam Reddy said real estate companies have already purchased sizeable chunks of land in the catchment area over the past decade or so. They now want to carry out construction work legally.

This is not the first time the state government has tried to repeal the 1996 order.

The first attempt was made in 2014, as soon as Telangana was carved out of Andhra Pradesh. That year, there were also efforts to set up a polluting industry along the lake. The move was stalled after Singh moved NGT, which asked the chief secretary to submit a report on the number of encroachments in the 84 villages.

A government report issued at the time said there were 12,500 illegal structures in the catchment villages. Singh says the actual number is over 20,000. “The area also has government buildings that are illegal,” he said.

In 2016, the state government constituted an expert committee to study the merits of the order. Singh alleges the committee was supposed to submit its report in 45 days, but never released its findings.

More than half the world’s population faces water scarcity for at least one month every year. Meanwhile, some people have to deal with too much water, while others have access to only poor water quality. That’s billions of people living with drought in Africa and India, facing flood risks in Bangladesh or lacking clean water due to excessive fertilizer use in the United States, Brazil, China and India.

Climate change exacerbates global water insecurity because it contributes to more frequent and severe droughts, floods and extreme rainfall, accelerated glacier melt, rapid declines in groundwater and the deterioration of water quality. These water-related risks have negative repercussions for agriculture, energy production, water infrastructure and economic productivity, as well as human health, development and well-being around the world.

Water is central to the discussions about how societies, economies and governments adapt to climate change, and the vast majority of adaptation strategies already in place are water-related. Yet researchers know little about how effective they are.

As a researcher in the field of climate change and sustainable food systems, I was part of a team that reviewed more than 1,800 case studies for the “Water” chapter of ‘Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability’, the second part of the Intergovernmental Panel of Climate Change’s Sixth Assessment Report. This newly released report is the most comprehensive review of climate impacts and how much we can adapt to them since 2014.

Water Strategies

The United Nations defines water security as having sustainable access to enough water of adequate quality to support people’s well-being, livelihoods and health, without jeopardising ecosystems. Water insecurity covers a spectrum of issues — too much, too little, too dirty.

Unsurprisingly, a large majority of countries have listed water as the priority for adaptation in their climate change plans. In our review of more than 1,800 climate change adaptation strategies, we found that over 80% were water-related. Some were in response to water hazards (droughts, floods, groundwater depletion, glacier depletion). In others, the response itself was water-related (irrigation, rainwater harvesting and wetlands conservation).

Yet when we looked at the outcomes of these water-based adaptation strategies, we found that only 359 had been analysed for effectiveness, meaning that we do not know if most of these strategies actually reduce the impacts of climate change and improve health, well-being and livelihood.

Adaptation strategies that are enacted without adequate investigation of their effectiveness not only waste scarce resources, but can also distract us from taking more relevant actions that carry larger benefits for the affected population.

Are Strategies Working?

Of those 359 strategies, most targeted the agriculture sector. Agriculture accounts for 80 to 90% of total water consumed globally and provides water to 70% of people in developing countries with their livelihoods. Many of these water-focused approaches included changing the timing and arrangement of crops, choosing better crop varieties and farming techniques, expanding access to irrigation and adopting water conservation practices.

Non-agricultural water-based adaptations to climate change included adopting better fishery techniques in Ghana, planting salt-resistant trees in Bangladesh, setting up desalination plants for urban water use in Spain and building flood-resilient housing in Guyana.

We also found that local, traditional and indigenous knowledge play an important role in shaping many adaptation responses. For instance, some farmers in Sri Lanka successfully adapted to the 2014 drought by practising bethma, a traditional technique where the community temporarily reallocated agricultural land among farmers so that each would have similar access to the limited water supply.

Combining local, traditional and indigenous knowledge with a technical understanding of climate change can lead to the development and implementation of more acceptable and successful climate change adaptation strategies. This not only ensures equitable and inclusive adaptation actions, but also increases the proposed solutions’ effectiveness at minimising climate change impacts.

Largest number of the adaptation responses, especially those in the agriculture sector, were implemented and led by individual households and civil society bodies. Schemes by governments at various levels of administration — from local to multinational — comprised the second largest chunk of adaptation strategies.

So far, the role of the private sector has been negligible. Private financing is a minor source of adaptation financing that has mostly focused on developed and emerging economies. Local needs, especially those of the economically disadvantaged communities, have not been adequately addressed by private financing until now.

At the climate change conference in Glasgow, global financial firms agreed to fund projects that address climate change mitigation. The translation of these promises into action remains to be seen, but adaptation projects in low- and middle-income countries could benefit a lot from this.

Unintended Consequences

But we also found that the strategies that work now, might not work in the future. The success of irrigation, soil and water conservation or other agricultural adaptations is contingent on how much warming occurs.

The benefits of these practices are mostly incremental — they have short-term rewards — and may not always lead to transformative outcomes, such as enabling a community to shifts its livelihood to one with reduced exposure to climate hazards.

Some responses have co-benefits: they not only help adapt to ongoing climate change, but also help mitigate (or reduce) future climate change. For example, reusing wastewater for irrigation can have adaptive and mitigative co-benefits. If implemented properly, such projects can not only provide a reliable water source throughout the year, but also reduce the pressure on water treatment infrastructure.

Some adaptation strategies, however, can have long-term negative impacts, called maladaptations. An often-quoted example is that of groundwater overuse for irrigation in India, which currently supports intensive agriculture but is depleting the limited groundwater reserves at a rapid pace.

Adaptation strategies can work, but we need to have a better understanding of their costs and benefits. If the world continues down a high-emissions pathway, these adaptation strategies will start becoming less effective in response to increasingly complex and severe water security issues.

Water is central to everyone’s health, well-being and livelihood. We must focus on adapting to climate change and mitigating its effects immediately and simultaneously if we are to lessen the hardships of the world’s 10 billion people by 2050. The longer we delay aggressive actions, the higher will be the adaptation costs and smaller will be the opportunity window to undo past actions.

Climate change is a severe global threat facing developing and developed countries alike. It is caused by releasing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) into the atmosphere, causing global warming. Carbon sinks are carbon reservoirs that take in and store more carbon (i.e., carbon sequestration) than they release. This helps to offset the GHG emissions partially. Forests and oceans are sizeable natural carbon sinks. Therefore, the protection and expansion of carbon sinks are effective strategies for mitigating climate change. Forests remove about one-fourth of the carbon that humans add to the atmosphere. Therefore, the protection and expansion of forest carbon sinks are essential to achieve global targets for carbon emission reduction.

Natural forest ecosystems which have thrived for hundreds of years, provide more efficient carbon sequestration services than newly planted forests or plantations. Therefore, while regenerating degraded forest land and afforestation are necessary, protecting the existing forest cover is critical. On-ground management and protection of Indian forests merit attention, and technology can play a major role in aiding the protection of forests in India.

Role of technology in the protection of Indian Forests

Climate change must be addressed through a holistic approach at all levels of engagement – policy, economic, social and political; technology is one of the key elements that can enable tangible outcomes.

It is imperative to understand the associated challenges to understand and facilitate technological interventions to protect existing forest cover. These can be broadly categorised as (i) accurate measurement and prediction; and (ii) threats to forest ecosystems from anthropogenic causes like forest fires, illegal felling and forest land encroachment, slash-and-burn agriculture, land-use conversion, land degradation due to pollution, etc. Technologies to address these challenges broadly fall under the following categories:

1. Forest carbon management:

To efficiently protect forests, it is essential to accurately measure the forest cover, carbon stock of the forests, and GHG emissions due to deforestation.

Procurement of reliable data, and relevant software for analysis to condense trends and make prediction models, are essential. With forests, systems to map biodiversity and forest health are also required.

Technological advancements in satellite imagery, such as hyperspectral imaging, allow for capturing granular details beyond the visible spectrum. Advanced analytic capabilities such as Machine Learning (ML) create intelligence by combining the data from multiple sources informed by climate science. The benefits of our technology advancements can thus translate into significant gains for forest carbon sink management.

2. Surveillance and monitoring:

Another field of technology interventions pertains to surveillance and monitoring, which are applicable across various use cases. These can aid forest officials and personnel in ensuring the safety of protected forest areas, forest fires, illegal felling and poaching, and taking stock and track existing and new forest resources such as tree cover and wildlife.

Satellite data collection and analysis, drones with live feed and automatic path and flight modes, thermal sensors, and geofencing for animal tracking – are some examples of technology in the domain. Vehicles appropriately equipped to traverse forest terrains are also a requirement.

i) Forest fires

Scientific studies like the Global Forest Resource Assessment (GFRA) 2020 have reported that forests are under increasingly difficult fire-weather conditions, with climate change causing extended fire seasons and larger fires. These will affect biodiversity, ecosystem services, livelihoods, and economies. Forest fires prevent future carbon sequestration due to the destruction of green cover and release vast amounts of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

Humans are responsible for 75 per cent of all global wildfires, which is even higher for India. As per the Forest Survey of India (FSI), India also has approximately 11 per cent of its forest cover in the highly fire-prone zone. This is a serious cause for concern regarding the loss of carbon sinks and GHG emissions and, therefore, a crucial case for intervention. Since most forest fires are man-made, surveillance and monitoring technology can help prevent these fires or check them before they can spread.

Deployment of cameras around the vast forest area, coupled with Machine Vision (MV) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to analyse real-time footage, can serve as a robust early warning system for forest fires and the human activity that causes them. Thermal sensors can be coupled with DAS (Distributed Antenna System) in forest fire-prone areas to detect any change in the ambient temperature conditions, thereby alerting the forest department of any excessive increase in the temperature. Protective helmets and vests with high-temperature tolerance, which allow greater safety and mobility through advanced materials (technical textiles), can protect the forest personnel involved in fire dousing. These technologies can also aid with other challenges in forest protection and management.

ii) Illegal encroachment and felling of trees in forests

Human encroachment and illegal felling are challenging, particularly in protected forest areas, where surveillance and monitoring technology interventions will benefit. These pristine ecosystems are endangered due to illegal felling for industry, land encroachment by private actors, and even land use change for developmental activity. Forest officials spend significant resources and workforce patrolling Indian reserve forests to prevent illegal encroachment, felling, and human-wildlife conflict. It is a task that requires legislation to protect the area and round-the-clock vigilance to ensure that the legislative directions are complied with.

Monitoring technology used to check human activity for potential fire alerts can also be modified to check illegal felling and encroachment. Regular and detailed perimeter drone surveillance can help build on-ground intel and awareness for higher field control and shorter response time to such activities, augmenting the manual patrolling efforts by forest personnel.

iii) Human-wildlife conflict

These monitoring technology interventions can also aid forest carbon sink preservation by protecting biodiversity, which is essential to maintain a functioning ecosystem. Various animals tend to stray past the boundary of forest areas and into the surrounding villages in search of food since there is no physical perimeter. This often leads to altercations between villagers and animals since the latter destroy farms and other valuable property, causing wildlife-animal conflicts which are detrimental to overall forest ecosystem health. MV and AI-enabled cameras deployed along forest boundaries can ensure the detection of animals straying beyond forest boundaries. Animals can also be equipped with non-invasive tracking devices with high location

tracking accuracy via GPS (Global Positioning System). A robust technical intervention can provide a holistic solution to this challenge, coupled with animal tracking dashboards with geo and RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification) tags and geofences. Technical textiles which can protect personnel from animal attacks while ensuring mobility are also relevant interventions for this issue.

3. Digital alert and relay systems:

Another category of technology interventions for forest management is digital alert and relay systems. Interventions which ensure quick access to information by forest personnel regarding any issues within the forests (such as forest fire or human encroachment and illegal felling alerts) will be an asset in forest carbon management.

4. Other issue-specific technological interventions:

These would depend on the particular issue faced by the relevant forest ecosystem.

For example, Invasive Alien Plant Species (IAPS) in indigenous forests or the over-proliferation of certain native species is another threat facing India’s forests. These disrupt local ecosystems, acting as an aggravator of wildfires and also damaging the forest’s ability to protect itself. For example, Lantana camara, an IAPS common in Indian forests, provides flammable fodder for the spread of forest fires. In the Himalayan forests of Uttarakhand, fallen pine needles (an overabundant native species) also act as highly volatile fire accelerants. Technology that can utilise fallen pine needles or other IAPS and convert it into fuel/electricity/other products will help remove these fire accelerants.

The insights above, gleaned from Mission AGNIi’s stakeholder engagements and secondary research, illustrate the relevance of technology in our efforts to tackle climate change, particularly in the management of forest carbon sinks. Technology is not the only solution to protecting our forests, but it is an intervention which cannot be overlooked. It provides targeted solutions to specific problems, augments policy-making efforts, and boosts Indian innovation. Therefore, the role of technological interventions in forest management is crucial for achieving our climate change mitigation goals.

1. Patriarchy continues to affect the lives of women by impacting their health and social outcomes through various factors like discriminatory values, norms, beliefs and practices. Comment.

Reference: Down to Earth

Introduction

Patriarchy is a complex and a mystifying institution of power and control in the society. Patriarchy signifies a male dominated structure which has a long history and has existed in every society in the world. It is essentially a system of male domination in diverse aspects of life such as moral authority, social privilege, decision making, control of property, political leadership et al. It has hampered the position of the middle-class working women in India in contemporary times owing to prolonged practices of the past and submissiveness of the females.

Body

Background

The Supreme Court (SC) has once again called for a ban on the two-finger test in rape cases nearly a decade after it first did so. It has said those who conduct it would be held guilty of misconduct.

A Bench made up of Justice DY Chandrachud and Justice Hima Kohli made the observations in an SC order overturning the acquittal of a rape accused in the Telangana High Court October 31, 2022.

Chandrachud, who will soon take over as the Chief Justice of India November 9, called the practice ‘patriarchal’ and ‘sexist’. He also ordered the two-finger test to be removed from the syllabus of medical education.

Why Patriarchy still persists

Reasons for persistence of patriarchy in our society:

The first lessons of patriarchy are learnt in the family where the head of the family is a man/ father. Man is considered the head of the family and controls women’s sexuality, labour or production, reproduction and mobility.

In a patriarchal family the birth of male child is preferred to that of a female.

Patriarchal societies propagate the ideology of motherhood which restricts women’s mobility and burdens them with the responsibilities to nurture and rear children.

Family is therefore important for socializing the next generation in patriarchal values. The boys learn to be dominating and aggressive and girls learn to be caring, loving and submissive. These stereotypes of masculinity and femininity are not only social constructs but also have been internalized by both men and

While the pressure to earn and look after the family is more on the man, the women are supposed to do the menial jobs and take care of their children and even other members of the family. It is because of these gender stereotypes that women are at a disadvantage and are vulnerable to violence and other kinds of discriminations and injustices.

Systemic deprivation and violence against women: rape, sexual harassment, sexual abuse, female feticide, infanticide, sati, dowry deaths, wife-beating, high level of female illiteracy, malnutrition, undernourishment and continued sense of insecurity keeps women bound to home, economically exploited, socially suppressed and politically passive

Patriarchal constructions of knowledge perpetuate patriarchal ideology and this is reflected in educational institutions, knowledge system and media which reinforce male dominance.

Patriarchal constructions of social practices are legitimized by religion and religious institutions as most religious practices regard male authority as superior and the laws and norms regarding family, marriage, divorce and inheritance are linked to patriarchal control over property biased against women

Male dominated institutions like church and state also lay down rules regarding women’s reproductive capacity

Need of the hour

Behavioral Nudge: For instance, by using taxes to incentivize fairly sharing child-care responsibilities, or by encouraging women and girls to enter traditionally male-dominated sectors such as the armed forces and information technology. Eg Supreme Court in India declared that women could now hold commanding positions in Army. Paternity leaves for men, to share the responsibility of child rearing. Incentivizing companies to employ women, and reach 50% target.

For instance, by using taxes to incentivize fairly sharing child-care responsibilities, or by encouraging women and girls to enter traditionally male-dominated sectors such as the armed forces and information technology. Gender Justice at Work Bridging the wage gap for equal work. Making work places safer through strong laws. India has enacted Sexual Harassment at workplaces act. Promote diversity and anti-bias courses for all employees. Comprehensive leadership training for women to excel in their fields.

Gender sensitization: Breaking the social barriers by gender sensitization and education at families, schools and workplaces. Eg : In the NCERT Books , gender roles, bias and prejudice inducing writings were removed.

Breaking the social barriers by gender sensitization and education at families, schools and workplaces. Eg : In the , gender roles, bias and prejudice inducing writings were removed. Social security and financial literacy : Formalization of jobs should be pushed to avail benefits to many women. Until then, social security benefits should be provided to women in unorganized sector. Eg : Self Help Group-Bank Linkage Programme in India Embedding financial literacy in programmes where women have significant representation could be a good starting point.

: Formalization of jobs should be pushed to avail benefits to many women. Until then, social security benefits should be provided to women in unorganized sector. Strong laws and policies wrt equal pay for equal work, maternity benefits are needed to promote women’s representation in economy.

wrt equal pay for equal work, maternity benefits are needed to promote women’s representation in economy. Political Representation:India has provided 33% reservation for women in the Panchayats and Local Bodies. Capacity Building and training can increase their capabilities further.

Conclusion

Gender equality is a human right which entitles all persons irrespective of their gender to live with dignity and with freedom. Gender equality is also a precondition for development and reducing of poverty. Gender shouldn’t be an unreasonable determining factor curbing the potential of women.

2. Critically examine the performance of Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), 2005. What are the various issues that need addressing to improve the performance of MGNREGA?

Reference: The Hindu , Insights on India

Introduction

The MGNREGA was launched in 2006 in order to provide at least 100 days of guaranteed employment to rural households. It is the largest scheme run by the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD).

An internal study commissioned by the Ministry of Rural Development has argued for decentralisation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme (MGNREGS), allowing for more “flexibility” at the ground level.

Body

How has MGNREGA fared so far?

MGNREGA works have demonstrably strong multiplier effects are yet another reason to improve its implementation.

It is a labour programme meant to strengthen participatory democracy through community works. It is a legislative mechanism to strengthen the constitutional principle of the right to life.

It has helped in increasing rural household income.

It has not only helped in increasing groundwater table in the last one decade, but also agriculture productivity, mainly cereals and vegetables and fodders.

The water conservation measures, including farm ponds and dug wells, have made a difference to the lives of the poor.

While the scheme was earlier focused on creation of community assets, in the last three years, individual assets have also been emphasised.

It has provided goat, poultry and cattle shed as per the need of poor households.

One national study found that MGNREGS has created valuable public goods which have augmented rural incomes.

Another national study found that, even after deficiencies in implementation, MGNREGS may have improved nutrition outcomes.

Even consumption has been shown to improve if MGNREGS is implemented well. A 2018 study of a better-implemented version of MGNREGS in Andhra Pradesh, where there was significantly less leakage or payment delays, estimated that MGNREGS increased income households’ earnings by 13% and decreased poverty by 17%

MGNREGS can smoothen food consumption of rural poor by providing them with an alternate source of income during the agricultural lean season.

According to a study conducted by New Delhi-based Institute of Economic Growth. there has been an 11 per cent increase in rural household income, 5 per cent increase in cereal productivity and 32 per cent increase in vegetable productivity,



Challenges to MGNREGA

Low Wage Rate: These have resulted in a lack of interestamong workers making way for contractors and middlemen to take control. Currently, MGNREGA wage rates of 17 states are less than the corresponding state minimum wages. The above study also noted that the MGNREGS wages were far below the market rate in many States, defeating the purpose of acting as a safety net.

Currently, MGNREGA wage rates of 17 states are less than the corresponding state minimum wages. The above study also noted that the MGNREGS wages were far below the market rate in many States, defeating the purpose of acting as a safety net. Case study: At present, the minimum wage of a farm labourer in Gujarat is ₹324.20, but the MGNREGS wage is ₹229. The private contractors pay far more. In Nagaland, the wage is ₹212 per day, which does not take into account the difficult terrain conditions. Similarly, in Jammu and Kashmir, the rate is ₹214 per day. This, the study noted, “is lower than what is offered by private contractors which can go up to to ₹600-₹700 per day”.

The funds have dried up in many States due to lack of sanctions from the Central government which hampers the work in peak season. Payment Delays: Despite Supreme Court orders, various other initiatives and various government orders, n o provisions have yet been worked out for calculation of full wage delays and payment of compensation for the same. The internal study also flagged the frequent delay in fund disbursal, and to deal with it suggested “revolving fund that can be utilised whenever there is a delay in the Central funds”.

The internal study also flagged the frequent delay in fund disbursal, and to deal with it suggested “revolving fund that can be utilised whenever there is a delay in the Central funds”. Case study: In Lower Subansiri district of Arunachal Pradesh, for example, the surveyors found that because of the delay in the material component the beneficiaries ended up buying the construction material themselves to complete the projects. In Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat, the delay in wages was by three or four months and the material component was delayed by six months.

result in the poor quality assets. Non Purposive Spending: MGNREGA has increased the earning capacity of the rural people but the spending pattern of the workers assumes significance because there ishardly any saving out of the wages

MGNREGA has increased the earning capacity of the rural people but the spending pattern of the workers assumes significance because there ishardly any saving out of the wages Workers penalised for administrative lapses : The ministry withholds wage payments for workers of states that do not meet administrative requirements within the stipulated time period.

: The ministry withholds wage payments for workers of states that do not meet administrative requirements within the stipulated time period. Too much centralisation weakening local governance: A real-time MIS-based implementation and a centralised payment system has further left the representatives of the Panchayati Raj Institutions with literally no role in implementation, monitoring and grievance redress of MGNREGA schemes.

Way forward

It is evident that the jobs under MGNREGS can only be revived through: Adequate allocation of Budget funds Timely payment for workers Complete decentralisation of the implementation Improving entitlements (wages, compensations and worksite facilities) Allocation for a year should include pending liabilities of previous years.

It should also respect the idea of the decentralised planning processes through Gram Sabhas across the country and allow adequate fund allotment as per labour budgets provided by each Gram Panchayats.

The government should come up with only one delay-payment report that accounts for the entire time taken and delays during the closure of muster roll and wages credited to workers’ accounts.

Also, the MGNREGA payment procedures should be simplified to ensure transparency and accountability.

Better coordination must be ensured among various government departments involved.

Better mechanism must be provided to allot and measure work.

Gender gap in wages under this scheme must be addressed. In this scheme, women earn 22.24% less than their male counterparts.

MGNREGA has been implemented for more than a decade now. It is necessary to understand its performance through output indicators like the number of workers, person days of work generated, quantum of assets completed etc.

The data collected can be used to compare inter-state and inter-district differences in performance.

In addition, MGNREGA must encompass provision for safe working conditions for the beneficiaries, like temperature checks, masks, hand washing facilities, proper hydration etc.

Conclusion

MGNREGA is playing a critical role in providing economic security for the rural population post the COVID-19 crisis. Therefore, the government must take steps to ensure that it is made use of to its fullest extent to address the current economic problems and bringing the economy back on track.

Value addition

Importance of MGNREGA

MGNREGA is vital for addressing India’s current problems.

It boosts rural demand and ensure economic development of the rural population

It seeks to bridge the gap between the rich and the poor.

This Act aims to improve the purchasing power of the rural population by providing them primarily the semi-skilled or unskilled work, especially to those living below the poverty line.

This can help solve rural poverty , farmer suicides, unemployment crisis in rural areas etc.

Furthermore, it is a scheme that has the potential to undertake progressive measures like infrastructure development in rural India, improving agricultural productivity through labour-intensive, supportive projects related to water conservation, drought relief measures, flood control etc.

This Act is also highly significant because it allows for grass-root level development as it is implemented mainly by the Gram Panchayats. It does not allow the involvement of contractors so that the workers under this scheme are not exploited.

It also stands out in its worker-centric legislation with a high emphasis on transparency and accountability.

If the government supports this Act, then it can become the solution to the present-day problems like water scarcity, climate change etc.

It is demand-driven wage employment scheme that provides additional 50 days of unskilled wage employment during drought/natural calamities.

Section 3(4) of the Act allows states/Centre to provide additional days beyond the guaranteed period from their own funds.

3. Discuss the importance of Black Sea Grain Initiative. Do you think this can prevent escalating global food prices emanating from supply chain disruptions?

Reference: The Hindu

Introduction

In a move that allayed concerns about yet another disruption to global food supply chains, Russia re-joined the Black Sea Grain deal. The reversal came a day after Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that Moscow would suspend, but not end, its involvement in the deal.

The Black Sea Grain deal endeavours to tackle escalating food prices emanating from supply chain disruptions because of Russian actions in the world’s ‘breadbasket’.

About the Black Sea Grain Initiative and its importance

The deal, brokered by the United Nations (UN) and Turkey, was signed in Istanbul on July 27 this year.

was signed in Istanbul on Initially stipulated for a period of 120 days, with an option to extend or terminate thereafter in November, the deal was to provide for a safe maritime humanitarian corridor for Ukrainian exports (particularly for food grains) from three of its key ports, namely, Chornomorsk, Odesa and Yuzhny/Pivdennyi.

The central idea was to calm markets by ensuring an adequate supply of grains, thereby limiting food price inflation.

thereby limiting food price inflation. Ukraine is among the largest exporters of wheat, maize, rapeseed, sunflower seeds and sunflower oil, globally. Its access to the deep-sea ports in the Black Sea enables it to directly approach Russia and Europe along with grain importers from the Middle East and North Africa. Russia’s action in the East European country has now disturbed this route, earlier used to ship 75% of its agricultural exports – precisely what the initiative sought to address.

The deal put in place a Joint Coordination Centre (JCC), comprising senior representatives from Russia, Turkey, Ukraine and the UN for oversight and coordination.

All commercial ships are required to register directly with the JCC to ensure appropriate monitoring, inspection and safe passage.

Inbound and outbound ships (to the designated corridor) transit as per a schedule accorded by the JCC post-inspection. This is done so as to ensure there is no unauthorised cargo or personnel onboard. Following this, they are allowed to sail onwards to Ukrainian ports for loading through the designated corridor.

Following this, they are allowed to sail onwards to Ukrainian ports for loading through the designated corridor. All ships, once inside the Ukrainian territorial waters, are subject to the nation’s authority and responsibility.

Moreover, in order to avoid provocations and untoward incidents, it is mandated that monitoring be done remotely.

No military ships or unmanned aerial vehicles can approach the corridor closer than a pre-decided distance agreed upon by the JCC. This too would require consultation with the parties and authorisation of the JCC.

Role in preventing escalation of prices

As per the UN Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, approximately 9.8 million tonnes of grains have been shipped since the initiative was commenced.

The UN Food and Agricultural Organisation’s (FAO) Food Price Index, which assesses the monthly change in international prices of a basket of food commodities, fell for the sixth consecutive month in a row this October.

Following the fifth consecutive month of decline, the supply situation in markets was seen to be easing, with the potential for further price drop

People hoarding the grain in the hope of selling it for a sizeable profit owing to the supply crunch were now obligated to sell.

The initiative has also been credited for having made a “huge difference” to the global cost of living crisis.

About 44% of the shipments, which include corn, wheat, rapeseed, and sunflower oil among others, reached high-income countries (including Spain, Netherlands and Italy among others), 28% reached low and middle-income countries (Egypt, Iran, Sudan and Kenya among others) and 27% reached upper-middle income countries (Turkey, China and Bulgaria among others).

It is important to note here that certain countries here may be re-exporters of a certain grain— thus, the indicator might only reflect the first point of export.

Conclusion

As Ukraine typically accounted for about 10% of global wheat exports before the war, the effect on global markets is akin to back-to-back droughts over three years in a major wheat-producing region, and it likely means that global stocks will not recover for at least another year. This initiative can be the solution to the current price volatility but then again, it alone cannot solve the escalating prices.

Introduction

Climate Change is a periodic modification of Earth’s climate brought about due to the changes in the atmosphere as well as the interactions between the atmosphere and various other geological, chemical, biological and geographical factors within the Earth’s system.

Climate change is accelerating due to global warming driven by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases and there is resulting large-scale shifts in weather patterns.

Impact of Climate Change on India

Coastal areas: 7500 km long coastline is already vulnerable to various disasters like cyclone, coastal flooding, storm surges, heavy rainfall (as seen in Mumbai) etc. The rise in the sea temperature and level will only increase the frequency of such hazards endangering the life and livelihood of the coastal population. Also, India being close to the equator will experience much higher increase in sea level than higher latitudes

7500 km long coastline is already vulnerable to various (as seen in Mumbai) etc. Monsoon : Phenomenon such as El Nino will increase the variability of the monsoon worsening the agricultural crisis with more than 50% area still being rain-fed and threatening the food security.

Introduction

SEWA is a national trade union registered in 1972 with a membership base of over 1.5 million (2018) poor, self-employed women workers from the informal economy across 16 states in India. SEWA was founded in 1972 by Gandhian and civil rights leader Ela Bhatt as a branch of Textile Labour Association (TLA), a labour union founded by Gandhi in 1918

It grew out of the Women’s Wing of the Textile Labour association, TLA, India’s oldest and largest union of textile workers founded in 1920 by Anasuya Sarabhai and Mahatma Gandhi. The original purpose of the Women’s Wing was to provide training in sewing, spinning, knitting, embroidery, and other welfare activities to the wives and daughters of mill workers.

Contributions of SEWA towards women empowerment

SEWA’s successful efforts have mobilized large numbers of poor self-employed women for empowerment. From small beginnings in 1972, as a group of poor, illiterate women working as casual laborers in the wholesale textile markets, SEWA’s membership has grown to 535,000 in its home state of Gujarat, and to around 700,000 throughout India.

The annual rate of membership growth has averaged between 25 percent and 35 percent in each of the past three five-year periods.

Earlier, with the opening of the SEWA bank and later the union, the women who worked in the informal sector became the stakeholders and social security was also provided.

There are 110 women’s collective enterprises in Gujarat, of which 65 continue to be active—more than six times the success rate of regular start-ups in India that have a 10 per cent success rate

Three years later, in 2002, it arranged sales of more than $3.5 million for 23,000 members organized into almost 1000 different producer groups. By far the largest shares in the sales total were for handicrafts and woven items (47 percent) and agricultural produce (43 percent) salt and gum accounted for around 5 percent each.

No account of SEWAs impact is complete without reference to the gains in self-confidence and dignity that members repeatedly mention and demonstrate in their everyday behavior. While these are extremely hard to measure, they are the very heart of SEWAs work, and their significance is enormous in bringing members to the point where they not only assert their rights, but also make effective use of the access they achieve

7. The uniform civil code (UCC) aims to provide protection to vulnerable sections as envisaged by Ambedkar including women and religious minorities, while also promoting nationalistic fervour through unity. Critically Analyse.

Reference: Indian Express , Insights on India

Introduction

A Uniform Civil Code is one that would provide for one law for the entire country, applicable to all religious communities in their personal matters such as marriage, divorce, inheritance, adoption etc. It proposes to replace the personal laws based on the scriptures and customs of each major religious community in the country with a common set of laws governing every citizen.

Article 44 of the Constitution lays down that the state shall endeavor to secure a Uniform Civil Code for the citizens throughout the territory of India.

Body

Background

Recently, Gujarat Home Minister Harsh Sanghavi announced the formation of a committee to implement a uniform civil code (UCC) in the state.

In May 2022, Uttarakhand announced a committee led by retired Supreme Court judge Justice Ranjana Desai to carry out a similar exercise. Assam and Himachal Pradesh, also ruled by the BJP, too have supported the idea of a UCC.

UCC helps in achieving the following

Promotion of secularism: One set of laws to govern the personal matters of all citizens irrespective of religion is the cornerstone of true secularism. A secular republic needs a common law for all citizens rather than differentiated rules based on religious practices. It would help end gender discrimination on religious grounds and strengthens the secular fabric of the nation.

Gender justice: The rights of women are usually limited under religious law, be it Hindu or Muslim. Many practices governed by religious tradition are at odds with the fundamental rights guaranteed in the Indian Constitution. Courts have also often said in their judgements that the government should move towards a uniform civil code including the judgement in the Shah Bano case.

This task will be very demanding time and human resource wise. The government should be sensitive and unbiased at each step while dealing with the majority and minority communities. Otherwise, it might turn out to be more disastrous in a form of communal violence.

This task will be very demanding time and human resource wise. The government should be sensitive and unbiased at each step while dealing with the majority and minority communities. Otherwise, it might turn out to be more disastrous in a form of communal violence. Time is not yet suitable for this reform: Considering a major opposition from Muslim community in India over this issue overlapping with controversies over beef, saffronization of school and college curriculum, love jihad, and the silence emanating from the top leadership on these controversies, there needs to be given sufficient time for instilling confidence in the community. Otherwise, these efforts towards common will be counterproductive leaving minority class particularly Muslims more insecure and vulnerable to get attracted towards fundamentalist and extremist ideologies.

Way forward

Major sensitization efforts are needed to reform current personal law reforms which should first be initiated by the communities themselves.

Current institutions need to be modernized, democratized and strengthened for this change. Sincere efforts towards women empowerment have to be taken for all women of all religions.

UCC can only emerge through an evolutionary process, which preserves India’s rich legal heritage, of which all the personal laws are equal constituents.

The social transformation from diverse civil code to uniformity shall be gradual and cannot happen in a day. Therefore, the government must adopt a piecemeal approach and no knee-jerk decisions.

There is need for deliberations and discussions among members of various communities to reach a common ground.

Conclusion

The guiding principles of the Constitution itself visualize diversity and have tried to promote uniformity among peoples of different denominations. A uniform law, although highly desirable but may be counterproductive to the unity and integrity of the nation. Hence, only those elements of customs and traditions should be brought into a unified law that causes injustice to individuals. In a democracy and rule of law, a gradual progressive change and order must be brought about.

8. Critically analyse the provisions of the draft Indian Telecommunications 2022 bill, which aims to address the issues in the telecom sector and improve the ease of doing business in the digital ecosystem, promoting innovation, and incentivising investments.

Reference: Indian Express , Insights on India

Introduction

The draft Indian Telecommunication Bill reimagines and reshapes the digital architecture while creating possibilities for the start-up ecosystem. The proposed draft Bill brings together telecom operators (providers of physical infrastructure), Over-the-Top service providers (OTTs) and internet-based communication systems under one roof.

The draft Bill consolidates three separate acts which currently govern the telecommunication sector — the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Indian Wireless Telegraphy Act, 1933, and The Telegraph Wires (Unlawful Protection) Act, 1950.

Body

Draft Telecommunications 2022 bill: Features

OTT regulation: The government has included internet-based and OTT communication services such as WhatsApp calls, Facetime, Google Meet etc under telecom services. It was the long-standing demand by telecom operators for creating a level playing field. At present, while telecom companies need a licence to offer services, OTT platforms do not. Further, bringing OTTs under the ambit of telecom services means that OTT and internet-based communications would require a licence to offer services.

The government has included internet-based and such as WhatsApp calls, Facetime, Google Meet etc under telecom services. Consumer protection: To curtail the ever-increasing incidence of spam calls and frauds, the draft Bill proposes that the identity of the person communicating using any form of telecommunication services shall be available to the user receiving such communication.

To curtail the ever-increasing incidence of spam calls and frauds, the draft Bill proposes that the identity of the person communicating using any form of telecommunication services shall be available to the user receiving such communication. Role of TRAI:T he current draft considerably dilutes TRAI’s position in a number of ways reducing it from a regulatory to a recommendatory body. First, the government would no longer be required to seek recommendations from the TRAI before issuing licences. Second, it also removes the power of the TRAI to requisition from the government information or documents that are necessary to make such recommendations. Moreover, the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) will no longer be required to refer back to TRAI the recommendations for reconsideration — those recommendations that it does not agree with, as it was required to do previously.

he current draft considerably dilutes TRAI’s position in a number of ways reducing it from a regulatory to a recommendatory body. Internet shutdown: For the first time in the Indian legal framework, a specific provision enabling the government to order suspension of internet power has been introduced through the draft Bill.

Challenges being addressed

Declining Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): ARPU decline now is sharp and steady, which, combined with falling profits and in some cases serious losses, is prompting the Indian telecom industry to look at consolidation as the only way to boost revenues. In 2019, the Supreme Court allowed the government’s plea to recover adjusted gross revenue of about Rs 92,000 crore from telcos, that further adds to their stress.

ARPU decline now is sharp and steady, which, combined with falling profits and in some cases serious losses, is prompting the Indian telecom industry to look at consolidation as the only way to boost revenues. Limited Spectrum Availability : Available spectrum is less than 40% as compared to European nations and 50% as compared to China.

: Available spectrum is less than 40% as compared to European nations and 50% as compared to China. Low Broadband Penetration: Low broadband penetration in the country is a matter of concern. As per white paper presented on broadband at the last International Telecommunication Union (ITU), broadband penetration in India is only 7%.

Low broadband penetration in the country is a matter of concern. As per white paper presented on broadband at the last International Telecommunication Union (ITU), Over the Top (OTT) applications such as WhatsApp, OLA and so on do not need permission or a pact with a telecommunications company. This hampers the revenue of telecommunication service providers.

Huge fluctuations in the duties on Telecom Equipmentwhich contribute to connecting the whole system from the central server to the consumer.

Limitations and concerns with the draft bill

Regulatory overlaps: The broad of the definition of ‘telecommunication services’ include OTT communication platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal among others, may potentially lead to regulatory or jurisdictional overlaps.

The broad of the definition of ‘telecommunication services’ include OTT communication platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal among others, may potentially lead to regulatory or jurisdictional overlaps. Unchecked use of State powers: The Bill gives broad powers to the central government in prescribed situations without any accompanying checks and balances. The Bill empowers the central and state government to intercept messages in the interest of public safety and emergency without the providing clearly defined guardrails for it.

The term, national security is left undefined and does not match constitutional precedent or text which instead uses the phrase,in the interests of the security of state Users Less choice in the privacy and security of their digital footprint:

Power to prescribe standards under Clause 23, which may result in regulations as recently issued by the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In) that have resulted in the closure of servers or services by leading, global VPN providers such as Proton and TunnelBear.

All of this practically means that users will have less choice in the privacy and security of their digital footprint, as these powers will lead to requirements to locally register and host data, and comply with requirements to identify users (KYC requirements).

Conclusion

There should be some reasonable basis or some tangible evidence to initiate or seek approval for interception by State authorities. Any digression from the ethical and legal parameters set by law would be tantamount to a deliberate invasion of citizens.

The Telecom industry in India is the second largest in the world with a subscriber base of 1.17 billion as of 2022. India has an overall teledensity of 85.11%.

The industry’s exponential growth over the last few years is primarily driven by affordable tariffs, wider availability, the roll-out of Mobile Number Portability (MNP), expanding 3G and 4G coverage, and evolving consumption patterns of subscribers.

The Telecom sector is the 3 rd largest sector in terms of FDI inflows, contributing 6.44% of total FDI inflow, and contributes directly to 2.2 million employment and indirectly to 1.8 million jobs.

Between 2014 and 2021, the FDI inflows in the Telecom sector rose by 150% to USD 20.72 billion from USD 8.32 billion during 2002-2014.

100% Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has now been allowed in the Telecom sector under the automatic route.

India is on its way to becoming the second-largest smartphone market globally by 2025 with around 1 billion installed devicesand is expected to have 920 million unique mobile subscribers by 2025 which will include 88 million 5G connections.

General Studies – 3 9. The decision to remove the unscientific ban on Genetically Modified (GM) crops reflects the determination of the government to move towards Atmanirbhar Bharat. It also meets the aspirations of our scientific community and farmers can derive the benefits of innovative technology. Critically analyse. Reference: Indian Express

Introduction

Genetic engineering aims to transcend the genus barrier by introducing an alien gene in the seeds to get the desired effects. The alien gene could be from a plant, an animal or even a soil bacterium. In most cases, the aim is to introduce a new trait to the plant which does not occur naturally in the species.

The recent clearance by the government for the release of GM Mustard Hybrid DMH 11 — based on the recommendations of GEAC under the Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change — is a bold decision in the best interest of our farmers and the nation.

Need for the GM Crops other than pest resistance:

Food Security: Given the increased growth of global population and increased urbanisation, GM crops offer one of the promising solutions to meet the world’s food security needs.

Given the increased growth of global population and increased urbanisation, GM crops offer one of the promising solutions to meet the world’s food security needs. Improved Stress Tolerance: Genes that give greater tolerance of stress, such as drought, low temperatures or salt in the soil, can also be inserted into crops. This can extend their range and open up new areas for food production.

Genes that give greater tolerance of stress, such as drought, low temperatures or salt in the soil, can also be inserted into crops. This can extend their range and open up new areas for food production. Faster Growth : Crops can be altered to make them grow faster, so that they can be cultivated and harvested in areas with shorter growing seasons. This again can extend the range of a food crop into new areas or perhaps allow two harvests in areas where only one is currently practical.

More Nutritious Crops : Plants and animals can be engineered to produce larger amounts of essential vitamins and minerals, such as iron, helping to solve nutrition problems in some parts of the world. They can also be altered to change the amounts of protein, carbohydrates, and saturated and unsaturated fats that they contain. This could lead to the production of foods designed specifically for a healthy diet for all consumers.

Resistance to Herbicides : Crops can be modified to be resistant to specific herbicides, making it much easier to control troublesome weeds. Farmers can simply apply the weed killer to a crop field, killing the unwanted plants and leaving the food crop unaffected. For example, GM oilseed rapeseed – the source of canola oil – is resistant to one chemical that’s widely used to control weeds.

Genetically modified foods have a longer shelf life. This improves how long they last and stay fresh during transportation and storage.

Positive aspect of the lifting the ban on G-Mustard and its impact on the farmers as well as scientific community in the country

It helps to meet our current challenges — over-exploitation of natural resources (soil, water, biodiversity), declining factor productivity, urgency to achieve sustainable development goals, especially ending poverty and hunger, and addressing timely the adverse effects of climate change

A major concern of our farmers is that yields of mustard are low and have stagnated for a long time at around 1,260 kg/ha, much lower than the global average of 2,000 kg/ha.

Mustard is a very important oilseed crop, grown in 6.0 -7.0 million hectares, mostly in Rajasthan, Haryana, Punjab and Madhya Pradesh. Thus, the government’s decision to allow the production of GM Mustard hybrids will go a long way in increasing our yields, while reducing the use of pesticides.

Allowing the production of GM Soybean and GM Maize going forward will also be a positive step, increasing both the productivity and profitability of these crops and doubling farmers’ income — a goal envisioned by the Prime Minister.

Concerns/Challenges associated with GM Crops:

Human Health Risks: Potential impact on human health including allergens and transfer of antibiotic resistance markers. The impact of growing GM crops poses risks to human health as their resistance to antibiotics can turn medicines ineffective and may result in the formation of new toxins and allergens. Toxins produced by GM crops can not only affect non-target organisms but also pose the danger of unintentionally introducing allergens and other anti-nutrition factors in foods.

Bio safety concerns: They can reduce species diversity . For example, Insect-resistant plants might harm insects that are not their intended target and thus result in destruction of that particular species. Cross-pollination in GM crops paves the way for herbicide-resistant super weeds that can further threaten the sustenance of other crops and pests because of its uncontrolled growth GM technology could also allow the transfer of genes from one crop to another, creating “ super weeds ”, which will be immune to common control methods. Viral genes added to crops to confer resistance might be transferred to other viral pathogens, which can lead to new and more virulent virus strains.

Implications on Farmers and Consumers: Critics claim that patent laws give developers of the GM crops a dangerous degree of control over the food supply . The concern is over domination of world food production by a few companies National Institute of Agricultural Economics and Policy Research’s anticipation that Bt brinjal’s high yield and increased shelf life will benefit consumers and farmers owing to cut in retail price of brinjals ignores the scenario that companies might charge premium prices for Bt brinjal seeds, in which case farmers may not benefit at all.

Economic Concerns: Introduction of a GM crop to market is a lengthy and costly process . It has not resulted in high yields as promised. For instance, the highest yields in mustard are from the five countries which do not grow GM mustard — U.K., France, Poland, Germany and Czech Republic — and not from the GM-growing U.S. or Canada.

Inefficient Regulatory system: Seeing the lapses in the regulatory system and irregularities in the assessment of Bt brinjal (in terms of labelling and unapproved and illegal sowing of GM crops) Parliamentary Standing Committee on Agriculture and the Committee on Science & Technology, Environment and Forests recommended: A thorough probe by a team of eminent independent scientists and environmentalists for commercialization of GM crops. Endorsed labelling GM foods to protect a consumer’s right to know .

Ethical Concerns: Violation of natural organisms’ intrinsic values by mixing among species. There have also been objections to consuming animal genes in plants



Way Forward:

The government must take decisions on GM technologies on the basis of scientific evidence.

Need to start cultivating an environment of openness and transparency to allay genuine fears

The government should adopt a participatory approach to bring together all stakeholders to develop regulatory protocols that restore trust in the process.

There is a significant uncertainty over their safety, so precautionary principle is that country shall wait till a broader scientific consensus is achieved.

Need for better policy, pricing and to rationalize the input costs

GEAC needs to be a transparent body. it should put it in the public domain that on what grounds it has approved GM mustard

There has to be strong liability laws if there are any environmental hazards or if something goes wrong in future

Agriculture is a state subject; therefore, it is important for the Centre to take into consideration the views of State Governments as well.

The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has rightly pointed out in 2004, “Science cannot declare any technology completely risk free. Genetically engineered crops can reduce some environmental risks associated with conventional agriculture, but will also introduce new challenges that must be addressed”.

Conclusion:

Clearly, there can be no credible argument against scientific experiments in agriculture that advance the goal of developing plant varieties that can withstand drought, resist pests and raise yields to feed the growing world population. But this should be done through a transparent regulatory process that is free of ethical conflicts. All this underscores the need for a cautious approach — one that fosters scientific inquiry, allows for scrutiny and is underpinned by regulation. Enacting a comprehensive law that covers all aspects of GM crops should be a priority.

Introduction

Crime and terrorism are critical issues for security officials and investigators all around the world. Earlier, the problems of organized crime and terrorism were considered as separate phenomena but after horrified incident of September 11th attacks, researchers have started linking these two as terrorized occurrences.

Body

Link between Organized crime and terrorism:

Though mostly both the phenomena are studied differently. Both have different ends. While the organize crime engages in various criminal activities for financial gains, terrorism engages in its violent activities for political gains. But recently, Scholars have stated that there is a strong link between the two. Terrorists are increasingly supporting them through terrorist activities.

Terrorism and Drug Trafficking : According to UNDOC (2017), annual trade of illicit drugs is estimated in the range of $426-652 billion, and the proceeds of which generate 1/5 th to 1/3 rd of the global revenues of organized crime. Approximately 86% of the world’s Opium cultivation takes place in Afghanistan in the regions controlled by the Taliban. The Taliban’s association with the opium economy also indicates a correlation between the trade-in illicit drugs as a criminal activity and terrorism.

Terrorism and Arms Trafficking: Terrorists are increasingly using automatic weapons to perpetrate attacks and there is a growing concern about arms trafficking groups supporting terrorism with the provision of advanced arms. The use of weapons by terrorists is evident in several recent attacks and attempted attacks across Europe. For example, in the ISIL inspired terrorist attacks carried out in Paris in November 2015, extremists opened fire with Kalashnikov and other types of assault rifles, which ended up in the criminal market as a result of cross-border trafficking

Antiquities are not only a source of revenue generation for terrorists, but they also have symbolic value. By destroying and/or removing symbolic representations of culture, terrorist groups effectively undermine the State/nationalism and attack the morale of local populations/peoples through a type of “cultural cleansing”

Recent actions by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL), also known as Daesh, and Boko Haram (Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati Wal-Jahad) in Nigeria have drawn attention to a growing nexus between terrorism and trafficking in persons

Recent actions by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), or Islamic State in the Levant (ISIL), also known as Daesh, and Boko Haram (Jama’atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda’awati Wal-Jahad) in Nigeria have drawn attention to a growing nexus between terrorism and trafficking in persons Terrorism and kidnapping for ransom: From 1970-2010, kidnapping incidents represented a small portion of all terrorist attacks (6.9%), however, through 2016 the percentage of kidnappings has jumped significantly to 15.8% of all terrorist attacks (Global Terrorism Database, 2018)

Reasons for the increasing nexus between Terrorism and organized crime

Both are realizing the complementary nature of each other in achieving their goals.

They have a common enemy in national governments and the rule of law.

Historically, the end of the cold war ended financial support to many terrorist organizations that led terrorist organizations to link themselves with organized crime for financial support.

Increased sophistication in money laundering as corporates engage in tax evasion that helps in the continuous money supply.

Issues of mis-governance and lack of governance.

The inequalities existing in society are manipulated by these organizations to grow their base.

Globalization has its side effects through the communication revolution and its anonymity. The cyberspace and dark web are increasingly being used to coordinate.

The outstanding geopolitical issues that are sought to be solved by governments through immoral activities like terrorism and crime penetration.

Difficulties in tackling the nexus

The legal complexities create duplicity of efforts and jurisdictional issues. These delays investigation and often gives unnecessary cooling-off period for groups to regather themselves.

The higher echelons of organized crime are insulated from its foot soldiers. Hence it is difficult to dent the structure significantly. There is difficulty in obtaining proof.

The main link between these two is network of financial transactions. The rising sophistication in money laundering and corporate greed resulting in tax evasion, unfortunately, helps the network of money laundering.

There is a lack of coordination between police departments of different states that makes organized crime and terrorist nexus easy to operate.

The criminal-political-bureaucratic nexus helps crime syndicates which indirectly helps in the spread of terrorism.

The state support for terrorism and unorganized crime makes it difficult for any international cooperation and consensus-building.

Dual criminality and the spread of nexus across the world make it difficult to track due to lack of international and bilateral coordination and cooperation.

Way forward

The nexus that is thriving due to complementary nature must be broken down so that it will be easier to tackle them separately.

There is a need for fine-tuning of the criminal investigation so as to find and establish links of a crime syndicate with terrorism.

Improving coordination and establishing specialized units to investigate. The specialized unit must have competent human resources, finances, technical expertise and appropriate legal backing to work in an unhindered manner.

The necessity of legal backing stems from the existence of numerous stakeholders such as state police, border security, financial sector, special units such as narcotics departments.

The interstate coordination is necessary and an organization in the lines of the National Counter Terrorism Center to tackle the nexus. It will help in national and international coordination.

India must continue to engage the international space for better policy, concerted actions against state-sponsored terrorism, and terrorist financing.

The international cooperation can stem from UNSC resolutions and other institutional mechanisms such as FATF.

Conclusion

In many parts of the world, terrorists are exploiting local grievances and poor governance to regroup and assert their control. “Collective action and international cooperation are needed now more than ever.”

The state’s long coastline faces the double threat of floods and rising sea levels due to climate change.
These reports highlighted that since climate change is bound to impact the seas, there will be an impact on coastal cities too.
Andhra Pradesh has a 974 km-long coastline and the climate change poses problems to the entire coast belt.
The Government of India released the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008 as part of an ambitious domestic action plan to address climate change.","Visakhapatnam: Rising sea levels, increasing ocean temperature, monsoon extremes and cyclones are the impact of climate change on the coastal areas of Andhra Pradesh.

While the long coastal line of the state in general faces climate change issues, cities like Visakhapatnam, Kakinada and Machilipatnam are particularly vulnerable.

According to scientists, the abnormality of the cyclones is the result of global warming and climate change. Visakhapatnam, the biggest city in the state and the proposed state capital, has experienced eight severe cyclonic storms since 2014.

Vizag, as the port city is also known, was battered by very severe cyclonic storm Hudhud on October 12, 2014. For the first time in modern history, the city witnessed an unparalleled natural calamity.

With wind speed of 165 kmph during landfall, Hudhud caused widespread devastation in the city and other parts of north coastal Andhra killing 60 people and uprooting thousands of trees, electricity poles and destroying the civic infrastructure. It took weeks for normalcy to be restored in the city.

Experts are of the view that huge disparity in the temperature of the land and the ocean may lead to formation of many cyclonic storms, which will have the potential to develop into very severe cyclonic storms. Strong winds and high rainfall will lead to an increase in the sea level.

The state’s long coastline faces the double threat of floods and rising sea levels due to climate change. The vulnerability was again evident in May 2020 when cyclone Amphan, strongest storm recorded in decades in Bay of Bengal, hit the coast forcing several million to evacuate

Experts say global warming has rendered monsoon erratic and extreme and is giving way to high intensity thunderstorms which will increase the possibility of flash floods and landslides. Moreover, during thunderstorms, the rainfall is quick and high and this also increases the sea levels.

Melting of the glaciers due to global warming is also causing the sea level to rise. Different factors are likely to lead to flooding of the coastal cities and regions

According to SSVS Ramakrishna, former head of the department of oceanography and meteorology, Andhra University, global warming has resulted in a rise in ocean temperatures, the temperature in the Indian ocean has risen much quicker than expected.

As per the report of the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Visakhapatnam is one among six Indian cities that could be exposed to coastal flooding if the sea levels rise by 50 cm due to global warming.

According to the report, the city will be under 3 feet of sea water due to rising sea levels by the end of the century.

However, some experts believe that Vizag is unlikely to be submerged because of its geographic location. The city is surrounded by hilly terrain of Eastern Ghats.

While low-lying and some other areas may be under threat, hills and hillocks may protect the city from flooding.

Vizag currently has a population of more than 20 lakh and projected population growth rate of the city is 2.35 per cent per cent. As the state government plans to make Vizag the executive capital of the state, the population is likely to grow further.

National Institute of Oceanography’s regional head GPS Murthy is of the view that the rise in sea level will be gradual. “The predictions of IPCC are based on present trends of temperature rise, CO2 release and melting of glaciers. There may be several changes by the end of the century,” he said.

In the previous reports too, IPCC had sounded a warning. These reports highlighted that since climate change is bound to impact the seas, there will be an impact on coastal cities too.

Andhra Pradesh has a 974 km-long coastline and the climate change poses problems to the entire coast belt.

Some experts believe that coastal cities Machilipatnam and Kakinada are facing a bigger threat due to the very small difference between the land mass and the sea.

The Government of India released the National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) in 2008 as part of an ambitious domestic action plan to address climate change. The NAPCC focuses on adapting to climate change and protecting the vulnerable sections of society through an inclusive and sustainable development strategy that also enhances ecological sustainability and innovation.

Most of the adaptation challenges such as coastal zone disasters, droughts, adverse effect on human health, depleting water resources, are experienced at the state level and programmes aimed at improving the adaptive ability are also undertaken and implemented at state level.

Andhra Pradesh has prepared the State Level Action Plan on Climate Change (SAPCC) to enable it to address existing and future climate risks and vulnerabilities

According to the report, major climate change issues for the state arise in the agriculture and forestry sectors and in relation to the long coastline. Agriculture is severely affected by variability in rainfall and temperature patterns, while rising sea levels and extreme events of marine origin, such as cyclones, pose problems for the coastal areas.",https://cdn.siasat.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/ANDHRA-PRADESH.png,[],https://www.siasat.com/andhras-long-coastline-exposes-vizag-two-other-key-port-cities-to-climate-impact-2455883/

The 'Save Soil' movement is urging nations to mandate 3-6 per cent organic content in agricultural soils around the world through policy driven initiatives.
Also, experts like Antony of 'A Growing Culture' believe that while industrial agriculture is the main factor for soil degradation, the ‘Save Soil’ movement makes it sound like the soil was ruined because of our collective abuse of the environment.","In March 2022, renowned spiritual leader and yoga proponent Sadhguru set out on a 100-day motorbike journey covering 27 countries and a distance of 30,000 kilometres to raise awareness about the widespread loss and degradation of soil—one of the most serious and alarming environmental issues in the modern era. He hit the road in front of London’s Parliament Square and traversed Europe and the Middle East—meeting government leaders, influencers, and the general public—before coming to a halt in India in June.

The 'Save Soil' campaign has been gaining traction both home and abroad, with thousands of eminent figures, including scientists, celebrities, policy experts, and even heads of states coming together with this common goal. Sadhguru’s Isha Foundation, based in Coimbatore, says 81 countries, two United Nations agencies— United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and the World Food Programme (WFP)—and the International Union of Conservation of Nature (IUCN) have already pledged their support to this campaign.

The movement has come up as a wake-up call at a time when soil extinction in India as well as across the globe call for urgent intervention from governments and policy makers. According to a United Nations report, almost one-third of the world's farmable land has disappeared in the last four decades due to intensive agricultural practices. If the current rate of loss continues, all of the world's topsoil could become unproductive within 60 years, posing a major threat to food security and exacerbating the issue of climate change.

Why is healthy soil important

Soil degradation is the physical, chemical and biological decline in soil quality due to its improper or poor management for agriculture, industrial or urban purposes. The degradation can involve water erosion, wind erosion, salinity, loss of organic matter, fertility decline, soil acidity, structure decline, mass movement or soil contamination.

Healthy soil will be teeming with biodiversity. According to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, millions of microscopic and larger organisms in the soil “perform many vital functions including converting dead and decaying matter as well as minerals to plant nutrients, controlling plant disease and insect and weed pests, improving soil structure with positive effects for soil water and nutrient holding capacity, and ultimately improving crop production”.

The minerals and microbes in soil help clean water by filtering and buffering potential pollutants. Organisms like earthworms, ants and termites also facilitate this process by creating channels and routes for water and air to flow through. Moreover, soil is the second largest carbon sink after the ocean, thereby playing a crucial role in mitigating climate change.

India’s depleting soil cover

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has set a 2030 target for India to become land degradation neutral, a state “whereby the amount and quality of land resources, necessary to support ecosystem functions and services and enhance food security, remains stable or increases within specified temporal and spatial scales and ecosystems,” according to UN Convention to Combat Desertification.

However, data released by the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) shows a grim picture with almost all Indian states recording an increase in degraded land in the past 15 years. As per the latest Desertification and Land Degradation Atlas of the ISRO published in June 2021, 87.85 million hectors of land in India (around 30 per cent of the country's geographical area) has already been degraded, of which 3.32 mha was added between 2003 and 2019 alone. Interestingly and alarmingly, the biodiversity-rich northeastern states recorded the most rapid increase in degraded soil. Rajasthan, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka have the highest area of degrading land.

A TERI study urges government to speed up the process of reclamation as the cost of land degradation will outstrip the cost of reclamation in 2030 | AP

In Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Delhi, Gujarat, and Goa, the area of degrading land account for more than 50 per cent of each of their total area. Rajasthan, however, along with Uttar Pradesh and Telangana—has recorded a reduction in the degrading soil as these three states combinedly reclaimed around 0.7 mha of land in the last 15 years.

An analysis of the ISRO data done by the environmental magazine Down to Earth shows that more than half of the degraded land in the country is either rainfed farmland, responsible for the food security in the country, or forest land that offers the best defence against climate change. Around 37 mha of the degraded land falls in the 'agriculture unirrigated' category. The DTE analysis further claims that water erosion is the most common reason (80 per cent) for degradation of unirrigated farmland, followed by wind erosion, salinity/alkanility in land and water logging.

A 2022 report of the Centre for Science and Environment, too, reiterates the gravity of the situation as it claims 13 Indian states/UTs have over 30 per cent of land under degradation—Jharkhand, Rajasthan, Delhi, Goa, Gujarat, Nagaland, Maharashtra, Himachal Pradesh, Tripura, Ladakh, Karnataka, Odisha and Telangana. As per the report, in Jharkhand, Rajasthan and Delhi, more than 60 per cent of land is under degradation.

India supports 18 per cent of the world's human population and 15 per cent of the livestock, but has only 2.4 per cent of the world's land area. The country, where agriculture is a large contributor to the GDP, is already paying a heavy price for soil degradation. The Energy and Resources Institute (TERI) has estimated that the economic losses from land degradation and change of land use in 2014-15 stood at 2.54 percent of India’s GDP or Rs. 3.17 lakh crore. Almost 82 per cent of the estimated cost is on account of land degradation and 18 per cent due to land use change. The TERI study further urges government to speed up the process of reclamation as the cost of land degradation will outstrip the cost of reclamation in 2030.

According to experts, the wrong and inappropriate farming practices that led to widespread land degradation in India in the recent decades included low and imbalanced fertilization, excessive tillage and use of heavy machinery, crop residue burning and inadequate organic matter inputs, poor irrigation and water management, poor crop rotations, pesticide overuse and soil pollution. Overgrazing, deforestation, careless forest management, rampant industrialization and urbanization, infrastructure development and mining are the other major human-induced causes for loss of fertile land.

Land shortage, land fragmentation, poor economy, and population have also contributed to the degradation of land, along with natural causes such as earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, landslides and floods.

Policy interventions need of the hour

PM Modi says India is working towards restoring 26 million hectors of degraded land by 2030. This, he claims, would contribute to India's commitment to achieve an additional carbon sink of 2.5 to 3 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. However, it would require a major policy overhaul, since experts point out that even though more than half of India's farm land remains rainfed, the country's farm policy has always encouraged resource sensitive and chemical intensive cropping, which work well in irrigated farms.

The government, however, has taken a few promising steps. In his address on the World Environmental Day, Modi informed that the government has focused on five main things to save soil. 1) How to make the soil chemical free. 2) How to save the organisms that live in the soil, which are called Soil Organic Matter in technical language. 3) How to maintain soil moisture, how to increase the availability of water till it. 4) How to remove the damage that is happening to the soil due to less groundwater. 5) How to stop the continuous erosion of soil due to the reduction of forests.

He also claimed that the Soil Health Card, launched in 2015, has played an important role in changing the mindset of farmers. These cards provide every farmer with soil nutrient status of his land and teach him about the dosage of fertilizers to be maintained for good soil health.

In last year’s budget, the government announced natural farming along the Ganga river corridor. In March, the Centre started the rejuvenation project of 13 rivers, which it claims will help in increasing the forest cover by over 7,400 sq km. Schemes like Parampragat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) and Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region also promote low cost organic farming. PM Krishi Sinchayi Yojana and ‘Per drop more Crop’ campaign seek to educate farmers on how to maintain soil moisture, while National Afforestation Programme (NAP) and Green India Mission (GIM) aim to control continuous erosion of soil due to the reduction of forests.

However, given the pace of soil degradation, the government will have to do more and further harmonise the existing policies at the central and state level.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi says India is working towards restoring 26 million hectors of degraded land by 2030.

The 'Save Soil' movement is urging nations to mandate 3-6 per cent organic content in agricultural soils around the world through policy driven initiatives. The average organic content in India’s soil is 0.68 per cent, but nearly 60 per cent of the land has below 0.5 per cent.

In December 2022, Sadhguru, along with renowned soil experts and scientists, released a Global Save Soil Policy Handbook for seven regions—Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Middle East and Northern Africa, North America and Oceania—offering “practical and scientific policy recommendations” that the governments can put into action to revitalize the soil.

The document puts forward a three-pronged strategy, including attractive incentive for farmers to reach the minimum threshold of 3-6 per cent organic content. Facilitating and streamlining of carbon credit for farmers and developing a mark of superior quality for food grown from soils that have the target 3-6 per cent organic content level are the other two policy recommendations. “Alongside this, we should also clearly articulate the various health, nutritional, and preventive health benefits of consuming such foods. As a result of this initiative, people would be more healthy, more productive, and more resilient – thereby leading to gains in man-days, and a lower stress on our health care systems,” the document says.

In its Asia-specific recommendations, the document calls for a Package of Practices (PoP) where all the work done by the research institutes will be cataloged and documented. The nutritional requirements and means of production for specific crops should be precisely articulated to avoid problems that arise due to excess usage of inputs or application of the wrong inputs. Implementing this will ensure the pollution and contamination of soils from excess use of agrochemicals does not occur, says the handbook.

The documents points out the lack of a farmer ecosystem, and suggests that farmers be given hands-on training on their land to adopt sustainable soil management (SSM) practices. “Soil doctors” must be developed and nurtured to support farmers in their region and farmers must be rewarded for ecosystem services provided by their SSM practices, it says. Standardisation of indicators to assess soil health and setting up of laboratories to conduct biological, physical and chemical properties of soil are the other major recommendations of the document.

But, not all are impressed. While the ‘Save Soil’ campaign’s recommendations for all nations remain oriented around the same 3-6 per cent soil organic matter goal, some experts point out that increasing organic matter by any amount will help boost fertility, improve biodiversity and fight climate change. “Fixing on a specific number obscures the variations in soil types across countries and environments,” Jo Handelsman, a noted biologist, tells the Grist. Also, experts like Antony of 'A Growing Culture' believe that while industrial agriculture is the main factor for soil degradation, the ‘Save Soil’ movement makes it sound like the soil was ruined because of our collective abuse of the environment.

However, all ecofreaks have been unanimous in admitting what Sadhguru called attention to is a very dire situation and it is high time the governments formulated policies that revitalise ecolology and soil.",https://www.theweek.in/content/dam/week/news/india/images/2023/1/7/land-degradation-reuters1.jpg,[],https://www.theweek.in/news/india/2023/01/07/save-soil-why-india-should-listen-to-this-clarion-call.html

Siddipet: Health Minister T Harish Rao on Thursday inaugurated the Sathya Sai Health and Education Trust’s Sanjeevani Child Heartcare and Research Centre on the outskirts of Kondapaka Mandal. It is the fourth such centre set up in India and the first in South India. The trust has set up such centers in Chhattisgarh, Haryana and Maharashtra earlier. The facility will offer pediatric cardiac daycare services.

Addressing the gathering after the inaugural function, the Health Minister said one in every 100 children was suffering from heart ailments in India. Saying that the State government would identify children suffering from heart ailments in all the districts, Rao said the district administrations would then send them to the Heartcare Centre. Thanking the Trust representative Sadguru Madusudhana Sai for setting up such a hospital in the Siddipet district, Harish Rao said it would be useful for poor families, whose children were suffering from such ailments, in Telangana.

The hospital would be a Centre of Excellence for entire South India, he said, adding that the trust was providing health services where it was difficult for the government to reach out to the needy. Rao has also thanked the State government Advisor’s KV Ramana Chary for pursuing the trust to get the project materialised.

Agricultural loans for the year to May 2022 amounted to the equivalent of $3 billion, or a fifth of the value of all loans distributed in Bangladesh.

Increasingly frequent and severe storms therefore pose as much of a threat to the country’s financial sector as to farming communities and the environment.

The warming of the sea in the Bay of Bengal as a result of climate change is supercharging storms, giving them more energy, helping them to drive tidal surges farther inland and dump larger volumes of rain than before.

When the super cyclone Amphan made landfall in Bangladesh in May 2020, 55,000 houses were destroyed in the country. Wasim Ali, 45, lived in one of them. The tidal surge that the storm whipped up swept away his house and razed his small one-acre farm in Protapnagar in Bangladesh’s southwestern Satkhira district. Tens of thousands of people were left destitute after this massive natural disaster. But misery runs deeper for Wasim.

In addition to the loss of his home and farm, the disaster also left him with no way to pay back a debt of 42,000 takas ($440), an amount he’d borrowed from a bank as an agricultural loan. He’d pledged his farmland as collateral, and says he’s now afraid to face the bank’s officials.

“I can barely support my family of five on the small piece of land I managed to squeeze out since the disaster. It is impossible to repay the loan against a piece of land that does not even exist anymore,” Wasim says.

Collateral pledged for loan wiped out



Nearly a third of Bangladesh’s total land mass lies in its coastal zone, spanning 47,201 square kilometers (18,224 square miles), according to a study. This zone is home to about 35 million people, or 29% of the country’s population.

These communities are heavily dependent on agriculture, working on their small, fragmented lands. In a form of short-term assistance, the government makes available up to 50,000 takas (about $530) in agriculture loans to individual small farmers, disbursed through commercial banks. These loans carry interest rates ranging from 5-10% for a single crop season, depending on the bank and the type of crop, and farmers are meant to pay back the principal plus interest after harvest.

Although the loan amounts are small at the individual level, collectively, agricultural loans make up a major part of Bangladesh’s banking activity. The country’s central bank says agricultural loans for the year to May 2022 amounted to 284 billion takas ($3 billion). That constituted 20% of all loans distributed in the nation during that period. One agriculture-focused lender, state-owned Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB), disbursed 200 billion takas ($2.1 billion) of those farm loans.

For these banks, however, the coastal regions are a headache: farmers here are increasingly defaulting on their payments as a result of climate change-induced natural disasters.

According to BKB, the two most affected subdistricts of Satkhira — Assasuni and Shyamnagar — have outstanding loans totaling 78.1 million takas ($822,500 million), disbursed from its three branches in Assasuni, Gunakarkathi and Shyamnagar. Another state-owned lender, Agrani Bank, has 15 million takas ($158,000) currently on its books from two of its branches, in Assasuni and Shyamnagar.

In a visit to Assasuni, where Wasim Ali’s house and farm were destroyed by Super Cyclone Amphan, Mongabay met several other individuals in similarly dire situations.

Hasan Mollah has been classified a defaulter since another cyclone, Aila, hit the region more than a decade ago, in May 2009.

“After losing the land, I lost my home and source of income. To provide for my family, I was forced to move to the city. Even so, I was unable to come up with the 38,000 takas [$400] to pay back the loan,” Hasan said.

The central bank has since 1991 made concessions for farmer-borrowers like Wasim and Hasan who have been hit by natural disasters. These free them from interest payments as long as they repay the principal sum.

“Banks operate as a business by lending loans, so it cannot lose its capital,” BKB managing director Md. Ismail Hossain told Mongabay. “We have rescheduled loans and still have 21.3 million takas [$224,300] in that area that is classified,” or on the books.

Climate change-related land loss

A third of Bangladesh sits just 1-4 meters (3.3-13.1 feet) above sea level, and 80% of the country is a floodplain. The southwest coast, including the district of Satkhira, is less than 2 m (6.6 ft) above sea level.

That makes every millimeter of sea level rise a cause for concern in this densely populated region. Scientists estimate that by the year 2100, global warming will contribute to sea level rise of 0.5-2 m (1.6-6.6 ft). That would leave most of Bangladesh underwater.

For the time being, the Sundarbans, the world’s largest expanse of mangrove forest, are protecting the southwest coast of the country. But increasingly frequent and intense cyclones are bringing strong tidal surges that threaten to break down the resistance of the mangroves.

In Protapnagar, where Wasim Ali lives, a series of storms from 2019-2021, including Amphan, has rendered some 20 hectares (nearly 50 acres) of land permanently underwater, according to findings from the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), a government research institute.

The storms are also threatening another water-based disaster. The Water Development Board, responsible for safeguarding the country’s dams, says the Kholpetua River embankment, which runs through Shyamnagar and Assasuni subdistricts, has been weakened by repeated battering from storms. After Cyclone Yaas hit in May 2021, the agency undertook an emergency repair of nearly 12 km (7.5 mi) of embankment in Protapnagar, and nearly 5 km (3 mi) in Padmapukur in Shyamnagar.

“The whole embankment is in a vulnerable state as it was built around 60 years ago,” said Shamim Hasnain Mahmud, an executive engineer with the Water Development Board. “The cyclones are speeding up its decline.”

According to Bangladesh Meteorological Department data, the southwestern part of Bangladesh faced at least eight cyclonic storms between 2000 and 2020. Four were categorised as severe to very severe, driving storm surges as high as 6 m (20 ft). Three of those — Fani in May 2019, Bulbul in November 2019, and Amphan in May 2020 — hit within the space of a year.

Cyclones may be a regular phenomenon in the funnel-like structure of the Bay of Bengal, but climate change is making the storms more devastating. Warming sea surface temperatures increases the maximum potential energy that a storm can attain. And this past May, the water temperature in the Bay of Bengal hit record highs, according to NASA.

Storms with more power and water unleash more rain and raises sea levels, allowing tidal surges to rush farther inland. That’s why places like Protapnagar, 80 km (50 mi) from the Bay of Bengal , get battered by cyclones like Amphan.

Banks fail when farmers fail

CEGIS predicted that between 2021 and 2023, the Padma basin is vulnerable to 1,215 hectares of river erosion.

The U.N. disaster reduction agency estimates that Bangladesh’s average annual disaster losses could amount to $3 billion, or up to 2% of GDP, according to a 2021 World Bank report. In addition to its baseline losses from climate hazards, Bangladesh is likely to incur additional costs from climate change by the middle of the century. If mitigation efforts are not stepped up, this figure could increase to 9% of GDP by the end of the century.

Golam Rabbani, head of the Climate Bridge Fund Secretariat at development NGO BRAC, said the true amount of loss and damage will be much higher.

“It took five years to wash the saline off the soil after Cyclone Aila [in 2009], thus restoring rice production to pre-Aila levels, found a study,” he said, adding that loss and damage estimates only consider the immediate effects. “Data on migration or alternative forms of employment are not kept in the affected areas.”

Hossain, the banking director, said that since a bank branch’s profitability depends on local borrowers’ economic well-being, both migration and the loss of livelihoods are detrimental to the bank’s operations. “Banks also fail if they fail,” he said.

RAJANNA-SIRCILLA/HYDERABAD : Emboldened by the BRS-backed candidates’ clean sweep of directors’ posts in the Cooperative Electric Supply Society (CESS) election, party working president KT Rama Rao said that the people have yet again rejected BJP.

Accusing the BJP of trying to win the CESS polls by illegal means just as they in Assembly and other elections, he said that the people have outrightly rejected the “cunning” methods of BJP. For the record, the BRS-backed candidates have won 13 of the 15 director posts, except Vemulawada rural and Chandurthi posts which were bagged by BJP-backed candidates -- Jakkula Tirupati and Alladi Ramesh respectively.

In a statement issued here on Monday, Rama Rao said that the CESS election result is a befitting lesson to the BJP which is trying to privatise the electricity department under the guise of “electricity reforms”.

“This verdict is an endorsement of the BRS and its governance by the sections of farmers, weavers, Dalits, Girijans, and handcraft workers. With this election result, our responsibility has increased further”.

“Even common people have complete knowledge of BJP’s conspiracies with regard to electricity reforms, which is why they have rejected their candidates. The people believe that if BJP wins, it will install meters to agricultural pump sets, stop free electricity supply for agriculture, and also electricity subsidies,” he said.

Though BJP has tried to lure people by distributing money and other means, they stood firmly behind BRS, he added.

“CESS elections exhibit a strong opposition and aversion towards BJP in the hinterlands of Telangana. BJP has no place in Telangana and it has been proved in many elections,” he said.

Rama Rao said that this verdict also shows the love and trust people have in Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his governance.

Earlier in the day, tension prevailed during counting of votes at the Government Junior College in Vemulawada. Independents and BJP leaders alleged that during counting authorities colluded with ruling party leaders. Police detained them and shifted them to different police stations to prevent any untoward incidents.

Meanwhile, the BRS-backed candidates submitted a petition, seeking re-counting of votes for Vemulawada rural and Chandurthi posts. The recounting process was still in progress when the last reports came in.

Mid Manair Dam oustees’ JAC leaders who contested for Vemulawada rural and Boinpalli posts suffered defeats. Chairman and vice-chairman elections will be held on Tuesday.

BRS abused power: Bandi Meanwhile, BJP State president Bandi Sanjay said that the BRS has made a mockery of the CESS elections. He said that the ruling party resorted to abuse of power in the CESS polls. He said that the result has been changed in five places where BJP-supported candidates emerged winners.

He alleged that the BRS party members voted for themselves and announced results in their favour. “To declare an election in your favour, when the reality is otherwise, why should there be an election in the first place? Why waste public money,” he asked.

Job aspirants need to know every bit of information about the diverse aspects of environment

These practice questions focusing on Environment and Biodiversity will aid aspirants to prepare better for the State government recruitment examinations.

1. Consider the following statements:

1) A food web shows the main food links and interconnection of many food chains

2) Ecological efficiency denotes ratio between energy flow at different points along a food chain

Which among the above is / are correct statements?

a) Only 1 b) Only 2 c) Both 1 & 2 d) Neither 1 nor 2

Ans: c

Explanation: A food web presents a graphical representation of what is eaten by what in an ecological community. It shows the natural interconnection of food chains. Ecological efficiency is measured by the ratio between energy flow at different points along a food chain.

2. In ecology, an ecotone is a/an:

a) Transition zone between two biomes

b) Community plus its physical environment

c) Association between a species and a group of sites

d) Distinct geographic variety within a species

Ans: a

Explanation: The transition zone where two communities or biomes meet and intergrade is called an ecotone. Ecotone may vary in range starting from small agricultural field to large forest.

3. Consider the following differences between grazing food chain and detritus food chain:

1) While grazing food chain begins with green grasses at first tropic level, detritus food chain begins with dead decay of organic matter

2) While grazing food chain adds energy to the ecosystem, detritus food chain consumes energy from ecosystem

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

a) 1 Only b) 2 Only c) Both 1 & 2 d) Neither 1 nor 2

Ans: c

Explanation: Both are correct statements. Grazing food chain starts with green plants at first tropic level while the detritus food chain starts with dead organic matters at first tropic level. Energy for grazing food chain comes from sun while the detritus food chain receives energy from dead decay organic matter.

4. Which of the following statements is/are correct about carbon monoxide?

1) Carbon monoxide is highly soluble in human blood

2) Carbon monoxide is one of the pollutants used to measure the National AQI

3) Carbon monoxide is one of the greenhouse gases listed under Kyoto protocol

Rajanna-Sircilla: Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao on Tuesday said double bedroom houses would be sanctioned to all eligible people in the district. People who have had own land would also be sanctioned houses.

Speaking at a review meeting with officials to discuss the progress of various developmental works taking place in Sircilla, the Minister said nobody should be left without a house in the district.

Irrespective of political affiliations, double bedroom houses should be provided to all eligible families, he said, asking officials to prepare a list of homeless people in all mandals of the district with the support of local public representatives by Sankranthi. The assessment should be done in a scientific manner, he said, assuring houses to all eligible families.

A total of 6,886 double bedroom houses were sanctioned to the district. Of these, 3,952 houses were grounded and construction of 3,447 houses was completed, while 1,394 houses were already distributed to beneficiaries, Collector Anurag Jayanthi informed the minister.

The Minister, stating that it was the responsibility of Sarpanches, MPTCs, ZPTCs and MPPs to ground the houses sanctioned to their respective areas, said houses should be sanctioned to people in Vemulawada, Choppadandi and Manakondur constituencies on the line of the Sircilla segment. The distribution of houses should be done in a transparent manner through draw of lots.

Agricultural loans for the year to May 2022 amounted to the equivalent of $3 billion, or a fifth of the value of all loans distributed in Bangladesh.

Increasingly frequent and severe storms therefore pose as much of a threat to the country’s financial sector as to farming communities and the environment.

The warming of the sea in the Bay of Bengal as a result of climate change is supercharging storms, giving them more energy, helping them to drive tidal surges farther inland and dump larger volumes of rain than before.

When the super cyclone Amphan made landfall in Bangladesh in May 2020, 55,000 houses were destroyed in the country. Wasim Ali, 45, lived in one of them. The tidal surge that the storm whipped up swept away his house and razed his small one-acre farm in Protapnagar in Bangladesh’s southwestern Satkhira district. Tens of thousands of people were left destitute after this massive natural disaster. But misery runs deeper for Wasim.

In addition to the loss of his home and farm, the disaster also left him with no way to pay back a debt of 42,000 takas ($440), an amount he’d borrowed from a bank as an agricultural loan. He’d pledged his farmland as collateral, and says he’s now afraid to face the bank’s officials.

“I can barely support my family of five on the small piece of land I managed to squeeze out since the disaster. It is impossible to repay the loan against a piece of land that does not even exist anymore,” Wasim says.

Collateral pledged for loan wiped out



Nearly a third of Bangladesh’s total land mass lies in its coastal zone, spanning 47,201 square kilometers (18,224 square miles), according to a study. This zone is home to about 35 million people, or 29% of the country’s population.

These communities are heavily dependent on agriculture, working on their small, fragmented lands. In a form of short-term assistance, the government makes available up to 50,000 takas (about $530) in agriculture loans to individual small farmers, disbursed through commercial banks. These loans carry interest rates ranging from 5-10% for a single crop season, depending on the bank and the type of crop, and farmers are meant to pay back the principal plus interest after harvest.

Although the loan amounts are small at the individual level, collectively, agricultural loans make up a major part of Bangladesh’s banking activity. The country’s central bank says agricultural loans for the year to May 2022 amounted to 284 billion takas ($3 billion). That constituted 20% of all loans distributed in the nation during that period. One agriculture-focused lender, state-owned Bangladesh Krishi Bank (BKB), disbursed 200 billion takas ($2.1 billion) of those farm loans.

For these banks, however, the coastal regions are a headache: farmers here are increasingly defaulting on their payments as a result of climate change-induced natural disasters.

According to BKB, the two most affected subdistricts of Satkhira — Assasuni and Shyamnagar — have outstanding loans totaling 78.1 million takas ($822,500 million), disbursed from its three branches in Assasuni, Gunakarkathi and Shyamnagar. Another state-owned lender, Agrani Bank, has 15 million takas ($158,000) currently on its books from two of its branches, in Assasuni and Shyamnagar.

In a visit to Assasuni, where Wasim Ali’s house and farm were destroyed by Super Cyclone Amphan, Mongabay met several other individuals in similarly dire situations.

Hasan Mollah has been classified a defaulter since another cyclone, Aila, hit the region more than a decade ago, in May 2009.

“After losing the land, I lost my home and source of income. To provide for my family, I was forced to move to the city. Even so, I was unable to come up with the 38,000 takas [$400] to pay back the loan,” Hasan said.

The central bank has since 1991 made concessions for farmer-borrowers like Wasim and Hasan who have been hit by natural disasters. These free them from interest payments as long as they repay the principal sum.

“Banks operate as a business by lending loans, so it cannot lose its capital,” BKB managing director Md. Ismail Hossain told Mongabay. “We have rescheduled loans and still have 21.3 million takas [$224,300] in that area that is classified,” or on the books.

Climate change-related land loss

A third of Bangladesh sits just 1-4 meters (3.3-13.1 feet) above sea level, and 80% of the country is a floodplain. The southwest coast, including the district of Satkhira, is less than 2 m (6.6 ft) above sea level.

That makes every millimeter of sea level rise a cause for concern in this densely populated region. Scientists estimate that by the year 2100, global warming will contribute to sea level rise of 0.5-2 m (1.6-6.6 ft). That would leave most of Bangladesh underwater.

For the time being, the Sundarbans, the world’s largest expanse of mangrove forest, are protecting the southwest coast of the country. But increasingly frequent and intense cyclones are bringing strong tidal surges that threaten to break down the resistance of the mangroves.

In Protapnagar, where Wasim Ali lives, a series of storms from 2019-2021, including Amphan, has rendered some 20 hectares (nearly 50 acres) of land permanently underwater, according to findings from the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services (CEGIS), a government research institute.

The storms are also threatening another water-based disaster. The Water Development Board, responsible for safeguarding the country’s dams, says the Kholpetua River embankment, which runs through Shyamnagar and Assasuni subdistricts, has been weakened by repeated battering from storms. After Cyclone Yaas hit in May 2021, the agency undertook an emergency repair of nearly 12 km (7.5 mi) of embankment in Protapnagar, and nearly 5 km (3 mi) in Padmapukur in Shyamnagar.

“The whole embankment is in a vulnerable state as it was built around 60 years ago,” said Shamim Hasnain Mahmud, an executive engineer with the Water Development Board. “The cyclones are speeding up its decline.”

According to Bangladesh Meteorological Department data, the southwestern part of Bangladesh faced at least eight cyclonic storms between 2000 and 2020. Four were categorised as severe to very severe, driving storm surges as high as 6 m (20 ft). Three of those — Fani in May 2019, Bulbul in November 2019, and Amphan in May 2020 — hit within the space of a year.

Cyclones may be a regular phenomenon in the funnel-like structure of the Bay of Bengal, but climate change is making the storms more devastating. Warming sea surface temperatures increases the maximum potential energy that a storm can attain. And this past May, the water temperature in the Bay of Bengal hit record highs, according to NASA.

Storms with more power and water unleash more rain and raises sea levels, allowing tidal surges to rush farther inland. That’s why places like Protapnagar, 80 km (50 mi) from the Bay of Bengal , get battered by cyclones like Amphan.

Banks fail when farmers fail

CEGIS predicted that between 2021 and 2023, the Padma basin is vulnerable to 1,215 hectares of river erosion.

The U.N. disaster reduction agency estimates that Bangladesh’s average annual disaster losses could amount to $3 billion, or up to 2% of GDP, according to a 2021 World Bank report. In addition to its baseline losses from climate hazards, Bangladesh is likely to incur additional costs from climate change by the middle of the century. If mitigation efforts are not stepped up, this figure could increase to 9% of GDP by the end of the century.

Golam Rabbani, head of the Climate Bridge Fund Secretariat at development NGO BRAC, said the true amount of loss and damage will be much higher.

“It took five years to wash the saline off the soil after Cyclone Aila [in 2009], thus restoring rice production to pre-Aila levels, found a study,” he said, adding that loss and damage estimates only consider the immediate effects. “Data on migration or alternative forms of employment are not kept in the affected areas.”

Hossain, the banking director, said that since a bank branch’s profitability depends on local borrowers’ economic well-being, both migration and the loss of livelihoods are detrimental to the bank’s operations. “Banks also fail if they fail,” he said.

RAJANNA-SIRCILLA/HYDERABAD : Emboldened by the BRS-backed candidates’ clean sweep of directors’ posts in the Cooperative Electric Supply Society (CESS) election, party working president KT Rama Rao said that the people have yet again rejected BJP.

Accusing the BJP of trying to win the CESS polls by illegal means just as they in Assembly and other elections, he said that the people have outrightly rejected the “cunning” methods of BJP. For the record, the BRS-backed candidates have won 13 of the 15 director posts, except Vemulawada rural and Chandurthi posts which were bagged by BJP-backed candidates -- Jakkula Tirupati and Alladi Ramesh respectively.

In a statement issued here on Monday, Rama Rao said that the CESS election result is a befitting lesson to the BJP which is trying to privatise the electricity department under the guise of “electricity reforms”.

“This verdict is an endorsement of the BRS and its governance by the sections of farmers, weavers, Dalits, Girijans, and handcraft workers. With this election result, our responsibility has increased further”.

“Even common people have complete knowledge of BJP’s conspiracies with regard to electricity reforms, which is why they have rejected their candidates. The people believe that if BJP wins, it will install meters to agricultural pump sets, stop free electricity supply for agriculture, and also electricity subsidies,” he said.

Though BJP has tried to lure people by distributing money and other means, they stood firmly behind BRS, he added.

“CESS elections exhibit a strong opposition and aversion towards BJP in the hinterlands of Telangana. BJP has no place in Telangana and it has been proved in many elections,” he said.

Rama Rao said that this verdict also shows the love and trust people have in Chief Minister K Chandrasekhar Rao and his governance.

Earlier in the day, tension prevailed during counting of votes at the Government Junior College in Vemulawada. Independents and BJP leaders alleged that during counting authorities colluded with ruling party leaders. Police detained them and shifted them to different police stations to prevent any untoward incidents.

Meanwhile, the BRS-backed candidates submitted a petition, seeking re-counting of votes for Vemulawada rural and Chandurthi posts. The recounting process was still in progress when the last reports came in.

Mid Manair Dam oustees’ JAC leaders who contested for Vemulawada rural and Boinpalli posts suffered defeats. Chairman and vice-chairman elections will be held on Tuesday.

He said that the ruling party resorted to abuse of power in the CESS polls. He said that the result has been changed in five places where BJP-supported candidates emerged winners.

He alleged that the BRS party members voted for themselves and announced results in their favour. “To declare an election in your favour, when the reality is otherwise, why should there be an election in the first place? Why waste public money,” he asked.

Job aspirants need to know every bit of information about the diverse aspects of environment

These practice questions focusing on Environment and Biodiversity will aid aspirants to prepare better for the State government recruitment examinations.

1. Consider the following statements:

1) A food web shows the main food links and interconnection of many food chains

2) Ecological efficiency denotes ratio between energy flow at different points along a food chain

Which among the above is / are correct statements?

a) Only 1 b) Only 2 c) Both 1 & 2 d) Neither 1 nor 2

Ans: c

Explanation: A food web presents a graphical representation of what is eaten by what in an ecological community. It shows the natural interconnection of food chains. Ecological efficiency is measured by the ratio between energy flow at different points along a food chain.

2. In ecology, an ecotone is a/an:

a) Transition zone between two biomes

b) Community plus its physical environment

c) Association between a species and a group of sites

d) Distinct geographic variety within a species

Ans: a

Explanation: The transition zone where two communities or biomes meet and intergrade is called an ecotone. Ecotone may vary in range starting from small agricultural field to large forest.

3. Consider the following differences between grazing food chain and detritus food chain:

1) While grazing food chain begins with green grasses at first tropic level, detritus food chain begins with dead decay of organic matter

2) While grazing food chain adds energy to the ecosystem, detritus food chain consumes energy from ecosystem

Which of the above statements is/are correct?

a) 1 Only b) 2 Only c) Both 1 & 2 d) Neither 1 nor 2

Ans: c

Explanation: Both are correct statements. Grazing food chain starts with green plants at first tropic level while the detritus food chain starts with dead organic matters at first tropic level. Energy for grazing food chain comes from sun while the detritus food chain receives energy from dead decay organic matter.

4. Which of the following statements is/are correct about carbon monoxide?

1) Carbon monoxide is highly soluble in human blood

2) Carbon monoxide is one of the pollutants used to measure the National AQI

3) Carbon monoxide is one of the greenhouse gases listed under Kyoto protocol

Select the correct option from codes given below:

c) 2 & 3 Only d) 1, 2 & 3

Ans: a

Explanation: The National AQI considers eight pollutants (PM10, PM2.5, NO2, SO2, CO, O3, NH3, and Pb). So, second statement is true. Six greenhouse gases are covered by the Kyoto Protocol — carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydro fluorocarbons (HFCs), per fluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6). So, third statement is incorrect.

5. Consider the following pairs:

1) Agenda 21 – Rio Earth Summit

2) Restrict the production and use of persistent organic pollutants – Stockholm Convention

3) Control on transboundary movements of hazardous wastes – Basel Convention

Which of the above is/are correct?

a) 1 & 2 Only b) 1 Only

c) 2 & 3 Only d) 1, 2 & 3

Ans: d

6. Consider the following pollutants:

Rajanna-Sircilla: Municipal Administration and Urban Development Minister KT Rama Rao on Tuesday said double bedroom houses would be sanctioned to all eligible people in the district. People who have had own land would also be sanctioned houses.

Speaking at a review meeting with officials to discuss the progress of various developmental works taking place in Sircilla, the Minister said nobody should be left without a house in the district.

Irrespective of political affiliations, double bedroom houses should be provided to all eligible families, he said, asking officials to prepare a list of homeless people in all mandals of the district with the support of local public representatives by Sankranthi. The assessment should be done in a scientific manner, he said, assuring houses to all eligible families.

A total of 6,886 double bedroom houses were sanctioned to the district. Of these, 3,952 houses were grounded and construction of 3,447 houses was completed, while 1,394 houses were already distributed to beneficiaries, Collector Anurag Jayanthi informed the minister.

The Minister, stating that it was the responsibility of Sarpanches, MPTCs, ZPTCs and MPPs to ground the houses sanctioned to their respective areas, said houses should be sanctioned to people in Vemulawada, Choppadandi and Manakondur constituencies on the line of the Sircilla segment. The distribution of houses should be done in a transparent manner through draw of lots.

Stating that the 2BHK scheme in Sircilla district was far ahead than in other districts, Rama Rao appreciated officials and public representatives.

Hyderabad: In April 2022, a blistering heat wave swept through Hyderabad with the mercury hovering above normal levels.

Greenpeace India, when comparing the weather data of April 2022 and April 2021, revealed in its report that the city experienced 10 heat wave days in April alone this year. While in 2021, Hyderabadis experienced only one heat wave condition in the month of April.

The global non-profit environment group released data that shows how the 10 state capitals in India have witnessed adverse temperature conditions in April 2022.

According to the report, Hyderabad recorded a temperature of above 40 degree Celsius for ten days in April this year. Usually, the summer temperatures peak typically occurs towards the end of April and May. But, Hyderabad witnessed the peak early in April itself.

“In the month of April 2022, Hyderabad recorded a temperature above 40 degree Celsius from April 18. The maximum temperature recorded was 42 degree Celsius on April 22. The city experienced these temperatures for 10 days,” the report stated.

According to IMD, North, West, and Central India faced the hottest weather in 122 years.

The global non-environment group has analysed data acquired from Accuweather to study the average increase in temperatures over the month of April in 10 capital cities of India. It said that cities located in the plains and hilly regions have shown a drastic increase in the intensity of heatwaves, while coastal cities have fared relatively better.

The article by Greenpeace India stated that the number of hottest days in a year in India has increased from 40 in the 1950s to 100 in the 2020s.

This temperature rise is said to be largely due to increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, partially offset by forcing due to anthropogenic aerosols and changes in land use. These heat waves are yet another reminder of how climate change and global warming affect our lives.

With eight years left to meet the global goals on sustainable development, the country is off-track, the trends indicated.

Since 2015, the report has been tracking and ranking the performance of 163 UN member states on SDGs.

It is published by a group of independent experts at the Sustainable Development Solutions Network (SDSN).

SDGs are not mentioned in the latest central or federal budget documents of India, pointed out the report based on a survey conducted in February 2022.

India is on track to achieving SDG 13 on climate action, the report mentioned. But another report presented a grim picture.

Preparedness to deal with climate impacts is essential to deal with climate crisis, but the country has been facing major challenges in this area, flagged The State of India’s Environment in Figures, 2022 released June 2, 2022.

The report was based of the trends revealed in NITI Aayog’s index on SDGs.

The seventh edition of CSE and DTE publication was released online by Sunita Narain, director-general of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) and editor of Down to Earth.

India’s performance on climate action — (SDG) 13 — has slipped from 2019-2020. In 2020, the country’s overall national score on SDG 13 was 54 (out of 100) — a significant dip from 60 in 2019.

This decline in India’s overall performance is primarily due to eight states — Bihar, Telangana, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab and Jharkhand — whose scores have dipped under SDG 13 in the two years.

Overall SDG rank in 2020 SDG 13 Score (out of 100) in 2020 SDG 13 Score (out of 100) in 2019 Change in SDG 13 score Bihar 16 16 43 -27 Telangana 6 43 66 -23 Rajasthan 13 49 60 -11 Karnataka 3 62 71 -9 Uttar Pradesh 13 39 48 -9 Andhra Pradesh 3 63 70 -7 Punjab 7 51 57 -6 Jharkhand 15 25 27 -2

Telangana, the state which is among the top overall performers (rank six) in the country, has seen a dip in its score for climate action by 23 points.

It is second after Bihar, whose SDG 13 performance worsened the most (by 27 points). Besides this, the performance of 27 states / Union territories remained off-track in SDG 13, according to the CSE report.

As per the Government’s robust strategy to promote millets, Indian missions abroad would be roped in branding and publicity of Indian millets, identification of international chefs as well as potential buyers such as departmental stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets for organising B2B meetings and direct tie-ups.

In addition, ambassadors of foreign missions in India of the targeted countries and potential importers would also be invited to showcase various millet-based products, including ready-to-eat millet products and facilitate B2B meetings.

APEDA has planned to organise millet promotional activities in South Africa, UAE (Dubai), Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, Australia (Sydney), Belgium, Germany, United Kingdom and the United States by facilitating the participation of different stakeholders from India in some of the significant food shows, buyer-seller meets and road shows.

As part of the promotion of Indian millets, APEDA has planned to showcase millets and its value-added product at various global platforms such as Gulfood 2023, Foodex, Seoul Food & Hotel Show, Saudi Agro Food, Fine Food Show in Sydney, Belgium’s Food & Beverages Show, Germany’s BioFach and Anuga Food Fair, San Francisco’s Winter Fancy Food Show, among various other promotional activities to cater to the overseas markets.

India is one of the leading producers of millets in the world. As per FAO, world production of millets in the year 2020 was 30.464 million metric tonnes (MMT) and India’s share was 12.49 MMT, which accounts for 41 per cent of the total millet production. India recorded 27 per cent growth in millet production in 2021-22 as compared to millet production in the previous year was 15.92 MMT.

India’s top five millet-producing states are Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh. The share of export of millets is nearly 1 per cent of the total millet production. Exports of millets from India include mainly whole grain and the export of value-added products of millets from India is negligible.

However, according to the Government, it is estimated that the millets market is set to grow from its current market value of more than USD 9 billion to over USD 12 billion by 2025. The pre-launch of IYoM-2023 is scheduled for December 5, 2022 involving stakeholders of the supply chain such as FPOs, startups, exporters, and producers of millet-based value-added products. Besides, buyer-seller meets would also be organised in the countries of Indonesia, Japan and the United Kingdom to promote Indian millets.

APEDA would also organise food sampling and tasting at the retail level and in key local bazaars of targeted countries where individual, household consumers can gain familiarity with millet products.

For the promotion of Indian millets and its value-added products, the Central government has developed 30 e-catalogues on each of the targeted countries comprising information on various Indian millets and the range of their value-added products available for export, a list of active exporters, startups, FPOs and importers, retail chain and hypermarkets that to be circulated to the Indian embassies abroad, importers, exporters, startups and stakeholders.

The government is also mobilising startups for export promotion of value-added products in the ready-to-eat (RTE) and ready-to-serve (RTS) categories such as noodles, pasta, breakfast cereals mix, biscuits, cookies, snacks and sweets.

As per the Centre’s millet promotion strategy, major international retail supermarkets like Lulu group, Carrefour, Al Jazira, Al Maya and Walmart would also be roped in to establish millet corners for branding and promotion of millets, Ministry of Commerce & Industry said.

APEDA has also created a separate section for millets on its website and the country-wise and state-wise e-catalogues have been uploaded for information to the stakeholders.

The Government has also started formulating a five-year strategic plan for the promotion of millets and value-added millet products in the international market in association with ICAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad; ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad; CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore and farmer producer organisations (FPOs).

The Centre has created the Nutri Cereals Export Promotion Forum to give impetus to the export of potential products, including millets, and to remove the bottlenecks in the supply chain of nutri-cereals.

Millets have superior nutritional values in comparison to highly consumed cereals such as rice and wheat. Millets are rich in calcium, iron, and fibres that help in fortifying essential nutrients for healthy growth in children. Also, the usage of millets in infant food and nutrition products is increasing.

As per the DGCIS data, India registered a growth of 8.02 per cent in the export of millets in the financial year 2021-22 as it was 159,332.16 metric tonnes against 147,501.08 metric tonnes during the same period last year.

India’s major millet exporting countries are UA.E, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Oman, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, UK and USA. The varieties of millets exported by India include Bajra, Ragi, Canary, Jawar, and Buckwheat.

The major millet-importing countries in the world are Indonesia, Belgium, Japan, Germany, Mexico, Italy, the USA, United Kingdom, Brazil and Netherlands.

There are 16 major varieties of millets, which are produced and exported, including Sorghum (Jowar), Pearl Millet (Bajra), Finger Millet (Ragi) Minor Millets (Kangani), Proso Millet (Cheena), Kodo Millet (Kodo), Barnyard Millet (Sawa/Sanwa/Jhangora), Little Millet (Kutki), Two Pseudo Millets (BuckWheat/Kuttu), Ameranthus (Chaulai) and Brown Top Millet.

APEDA has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with IIMR to boost value-addition and farmers’ income.

Raj Bhagat, a private weather expert, even contested the declaration of monsoon onset.
The monsoon trough’s further progress over India may also remain slow with only intermittent rains in the beginning and dry spells.
The normal monsoon onset date for central India is during June 10-15.
“However, there is no clear relationship established between onset or the initial phase of monsoon and the latter phase of the monsoon.","The slow progress may lead to water scarcity, food insecurity and humid heat, especially for north-west India

India may be staring at a delayed and dry southwestern monsoon in the first two months, with late onset, intermittent rains and dry spells in many regions.

For Delhi and adjoining regions of north-west India, the dry spell may last through August 14. This could affect the availability of water for sowing of kharif crops in the region and farmers may chose to sow later than usual.

Thus the farming season may again be pushed back, as it was in 2021.

It may also mean a return of heat. Combined with higher humidity, that can make for a couple of hot, sticky months.

The much-awaited monsoon winds reached Kerala May 29, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) — two days later than earlier predicted but three days ahead of its normal schedule.

The weather agency further predicted May 30 that monsoon would advance over some parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and the north-eastern states in three-four days. There will be a brief dry spell over Kerala between June 3 and June 9 with 45 per cent less rain than normal.

The monsoon onset has been tricky this year. It set over Bay of Bengal May 16 — six days earlier than normal. This was due to the formation, progress and dissipation of twin cyclones Asani and Karim in north and Indian Ocean respectively.

For the past two years multiple cyclones later into May and even in early June helped pull the monsoon winds over the Indian sub continent causing early onset, even floods, in many parts of the country.

Cyclone Asani dissipated in the second week of May and helped the monsoon move into the Andaman Sea but did not pull it further.

Around May 20 the winds, after three days of good progress, stalled over the Bay of Bengal and have barely moved since then. There is a misbalance between the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal branches of the monsoon trough. The Arabian Sea branch has moved ahead causing the onset over Kerala May 29 and over some parts of Tamil Nadu May 30 but the Bay of Bengal branch remains stalled.

Raj Bhagat, a private weather expert, even contested the declaration of monsoon onset.

Rather than using fixed thresholds for declaring #monsoon onsets, we should start using (and developing) Monsoon #indices that talk about strength and phase which help us understand the patterns better. pic.twitter.com/ZzrOlmcVKJ — Raj Bhagat P #Mapper4Life (@rajbhagatt) May 30, 2022

Bhagat, who works for the World Resources Institute in Bengaluru, claimed views expressed on the microblogging site Twitter were personal.

The monsoon trough’s further progress over India may also remain slow with only intermittent rains in the beginning and dry spells. The onset over central India could be around June 14-19, forecast climate scientist Elena Surovyatkina. The normal monsoon onset date for central India is during June 10-15.

Surovyatkina, from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Germany, generates a monsoon onset forecast 40 days in advance for central India, Telangana and Delhi every year. She also generates a monsoon withdrawal forecast 70 days in advance for the same regions.

The monsoonexpert uses a unique systems perspective to declare the onset and withdrawal of monsoon over the Indian sub continent. Within this she observes the transition of the monsoon season based on temperatures recorded in the northern Pakistan region and a particular region in central India. When these temperatures cross certain thresholds she declares the onset of the monsoon or withdrawal of rains.

This year Surovyatkina has also included a forecast of intermittent rains and dry spells. For central India which comprises of south eastern part of Maharashtra, western Chattisgarh and northern Telangana she predicted a dry spell between June 19 and June 26 and continuous rainfall after that.

The rains may be further delayed in north-western India, which may bring back heat waves as Down To Earth wrote earlier. The onset of monsoon over Delhi may happen around July 10 with intermittent rains and short dry spells continuing till July 29. There may not be much respite even after that as Surovyatkina forecast a longer dry spell from July 29 to August 14, after which there may be more continuous rainfall.

This would mean a delay in the arrival of the monsoon season by 10-15 days, as the normal monsoon onset date for Delhi is between June 25 and June 30 and a wait of another month for more continuous rainfall. The rains for north west India had been delayed by almost three weeks in 2021 as well when the monsoon winds had stalled after a good initial progress due to many global climatic factors.

“A slow progress might aggravate the water and food security of those regions in the north/northwest India that have been already hit by a rain deficit and heatwaves during March-May”, Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, told DTE.

The latter phase of the monsoon may be better owing to the persistent La Nina phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is in its third year in 2022. The La Nina is the cooler than normal phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon and generally supports good rainfall over India.

“However, there is no clear relationship established between onset or the initial phase of monsoon and the latter phase of the monsoon. If ocean-atmospheric conditions are favourable, monsoon can pick up at a later time and makeup for the aggregate seasonal rainfall,” Koll said.

“At the same time, we need to be aware that a slow onset could have already hit the agriculture badly, and receiving the pending rains in a short time need not necessarily help it,” he added.

However Raghu Murtugudde, a climate scientist at the University of Maryland, explained that “the warm temperatures and the dust storm over the Middle East should favour the monsoon”.

He further highlighted that June rains comprise only 20 per cent of the monsoon season and the peak monsoon rainfall occurs in July and August which could be normal because of the ongoing La Niña. Even then he cautions that the “weaker monsoon circulation may dominate but La Niña should help”.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2021-06-19/0.01504700_1624074687_monsoon-1.jpg,['http://www.youtube.com/embed/https://youtu.be/DtkRhr0S5zg'],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/monsoon-2022-expect-a-delay-first-2-months-may-be-dry-83085

The Government has also started formulating a five-year strategic plan for the promotion of millets and value-added millet products in the international market in association with ICAR-Indian Institute of Millets Research (IIMR), Hyderabad; ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), Hyderabad; CSIR-Central Food Technological Research Institute (CFTRI), Mysore and farmer producer organisations (FPOs).

The Centre has created the Nutri Cereals Export Promotion Forum to give impetus to the export of potential products, including millets, and to remove the bottlenecks in the supply chain of nutri-cereals.

Millets have superior nutritional values in comparison to highly consumed cereals such as rice and wheat. Millets are rich in calcium, iron, and fibres that help in fortifying essential nutrients for healthy growth in children. Also, the usage of millets in infant food and nutrition products is increasing.

As per the DGCIS data, India registered a growth of 8.02 per cent in the export of millets in the financial year 2021-22 as it was 159,332.16 metric tonnes against 147,501.08 metric tonnes during the same period last year.

India’s major millet exporting countries are UA.E, Nepal, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Oman, Egypt, Tunisia, Yemen, UK and USA. The varieties of millets exported by India include Bajra, Ragi, Canary, Jawar, and Buckwheat.

The major millet-importing countries in the world are Indonesia, Belgium, Japan, Germany, Mexico, Italy, the USA, United Kingdom, Brazil and Netherlands.

There are 16 major varieties of millets, which are produced and exported, including Sorghum (Jowar), Pearl Millet (Bajra), Finger Millet (Ragi) Minor Millets (Kangani), Proso Millet (Cheena), Kodo Millet (Kodo), Barnyard Millet (Sawa/Sanwa/Jhangora), Little Millet (Kutki), Two Pseudo Millets (BuckWheat/Kuttu), Ameranthus (Chaulai) and Brown Top Millet.

APEDA has also signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with IIMR to boost value-addition and farmers’ income. APEDA launched a variety of millet products for all age groups at affordable prices ranging from Rs 5 to Rs 15 during AAHAR food fair, which is Asia’s biggest B2B international food and hospitality fair.

Raj Bhagat, a private weather expert, even contested the declaration of monsoon onset.
The monsoon trough’s further progress over India may also remain slow with only intermittent rains in the beginning and dry spells.
The normal monsoon onset date for central India is during June 10-15.
“However, there is no clear relationship established between onset or the initial phase of monsoon and the latter phase of the monsoon.","The slow progress may lead to water scarcity, food insecurity and humid heat, especially for north-west India

India may be staring at a delayed and dry southwestern monsoon in the first two months, with late onset, intermittent rains and dry spells in many regions.

For Delhi and adjoining regions of north-west India, the dry spell may last through August 14. This could affect the availability of water for sowing of kharif crops in the region and farmers may chose to sow later than usual.

Thus the farming season may again be pushed back, as it was in 2021.

It may also mean a return of heat. Combined with higher humidity, that can make for a couple of hot, sticky months.

The much-awaited monsoon winds reached Kerala May 29, according to the India Meteorological Department (IMD) — two days later than earlier predicted but three days ahead of its normal schedule.

The weather agency further predicted May 30 that monsoon would advance over some parts of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka and the north-eastern states in three-four days. There will be a brief dry spell over Kerala between June 3 and June 9 with 45 per cent less rain than normal.

The monsoon onset has been tricky this year. It set over Bay of Bengal May 16 — six days earlier than normal. This was due to the formation, progress and dissipation of twin cyclones Asani and Karim in north and Indian Ocean respectively.

For the past two years multiple cyclones later into May and even in early June helped pull the monsoon winds over the Indian sub continent causing early onset, even floods, in many parts of the country.

Cyclone Asani dissipated in the second week of May and helped the monsoon move into the Andaman Sea but did not pull it further.

Around May 20 the winds, after three days of good progress, stalled over the Bay of Bengal and have barely moved since then. There is a misbalance between the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal branches of the monsoon trough. The Arabian Sea branch has moved ahead causing the onset over Kerala May 29 and over some parts of Tamil Nadu May 30 but the Bay of Bengal branch remains stalled.

Raj Bhagat, a private weather expert, even contested the declaration of monsoon onset.

Rather than using fixed thresholds for declaring #monsoon onsets, we should start using (and developing) Monsoon #indices that talk about strength and phase which help us understand the patterns better. pic.twitter.com/ZzrOlmcVKJ — Raj Bhagat P #Mapper4Life (@rajbhagatt) May 30, 2022

Bhagat, who works for the World Resources Institute in Bengaluru, claimed views expressed on the microblogging site Twitter were personal.

The monsoon trough’s further progress over India may also remain slow with only intermittent rains in the beginning and dry spells. The onset over central India could be around June 14-19, forecast climate scientist Elena Surovyatkina. The normal monsoon onset date for central India is during June 10-15.

Surovyatkina, from the Potsdam Institute of Climate Impact Research, Germany, generates a monsoon onset forecast 40 days in advance for central India, Telangana and Delhi every year. She also generates a monsoon withdrawal forecast 70 days in advance for the same regions.

The monsoonexpert uses a unique systems perspective to declare the onset and withdrawal of monsoon over the Indian sub continent. Within this she observes the transition of the monsoon season based on temperatures recorded in the northern Pakistan region and a particular region in central India. When these temperatures cross certain thresholds she declares the onset of the monsoon or withdrawal of rains.

This year Surovyatkina has also included a forecast of intermittent rains and dry spells. For central India which comprises of south eastern part of Maharashtra, western Chattisgarh and northern Telangana she predicted a dry spell between June 19 and June 26 and continuous rainfall after that.

The rains may be further delayed in north-western India, which may bring back heat waves as Down To Earth wrote earlier. The onset of monsoon over Delhi may happen around July 10 with intermittent rains and short dry spells continuing till July 29. There may not be much respite even after that as Surovyatkina forecast a longer dry spell from July 29 to August 14, after which there may be more continuous rainfall.

This would mean a delay in the arrival of the monsoon season by 10-15 days, as the normal monsoon onset date for Delhi is between June 25 and June 30 and a wait of another month for more continuous rainfall. The rains for north west India had been delayed by almost three weeks in 2021 as well when the monsoon winds had stalled after a good initial progress due to many global climatic factors.

“A slow progress might aggravate the water and food security of those regions in the north/northwest India that have been already hit by a rain deficit and heatwaves during March-May”, Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, told DTE.

The latter phase of the monsoon may be better owing to the persistent La Nina phenomenon in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is in its third year in 2022. The La Nina is the cooler than normal phase of the El Nino Southern Oscillation phenomenon and generally supports good rainfall over India.

“However, there is no clear relationship established between onset or the initial phase of monsoon and the latter phase of the monsoon. If ocean-atmospheric conditions are favourable, monsoon can pick up at a later time and makeup for the aggregate seasonal rainfall,” Koll said.

“At the same time, we need to be aware that a slow onset could have already hit the agriculture badly, and receiving the pending rains in a short time need not necessarily help it,” he added.

However Raghu Murtugudde, a climate scientist at the University of Maryland, explained that “the warm temperatures and the dust storm over the Middle East should favour the monsoon”.

He further highlighted that June rains comprise only 20 per cent of the monsoon season and the peak monsoon rainfall occurs in July and August which could be normal because of the ongoing La Niña. Even then he cautions that the “weaker monsoon circulation may dominate but La Niña should help”.",https://cdn.downtoearth.org.in/library/large/2021-06-19/0.01504700_1624074687_monsoon-1.jpg,['http://www.youtube.com/embed/https://youtu.be/DtkRhr0S5zg'],https://www.downtoearth.org.in/news/environment/monsoon-2022-expect-a-delay-first-2-months-may-be-dry-83085

The Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare is developing Krishi-DSS, a decision support system, on the lines of Gati Shakti, using RISAT-1A and VEDAS of Department of Space. This will enhance the evidence-based decision-making capability of all the stakeholders in the agriculture sector by way of integration with MOSDAC and BHUVAN (Geo-platform) of ISRO and systems of ICAR.

Addressing the occasion, Union Minister Narendra Singh Tomar said that a new dimension is being added in the field of agriculture. “Revolution is being initiated in the agriculture sector through space science. The agreement between the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Space will further enhance the strength of the agriculture sector. If this knowledge reaches the farmers, their production and productivity will increase. The quality of production will increase and export opportunities will also increase.""

Tomar added that the agriculture sector is very important in our country and in the whole world. “Along with livelihood, this sector is working to speed up the country’s economy and provide employment to a large population.""

He said that earlier the sector had suffered due to lack of knowledge and private investment. “The amount of change, knowledge and investment needed in this area has not happened. This is the reason why the agriculture sector has not progressed as much as it should.""

The minister added that in the year 2014, when the Prime Minister took over the work, he had a desire to take the country forward. “Work was done to connect it with new dimensions. Because of this, all the departments including the Department of Space changed their working methods, fixed targets and planned effective targets. Its effect is visible in the country today. Agriculture Department is also working on AgriStack. Work is being done to increase the income of the farmer and to save him from losses by forecasting.""

Tomar said that crop estimation, allotment to states, survey to declare an area dry, disaster assessment, - all these tasks will become easy after adopting technology. “This technology is very beneficial for the agriculture sector as well as the country. After the completion of AgriStack, there will be a revolutionary change in the field of agriculture. “

A technical workshop was also organized by ISRO as part of the event, wherein case studies and potential applications were demonstrated using RISAT-1A data for the benefit of the user community. RISAT-1A data is received, processed and disseminated by the National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC), Hyderabad, through its Bhoonidhi Geoportal.

""If the rainfall deficit continues into the second and third week of July, it will have serious ramifications.
Let us be very clear, we cannot afford another disruption in the weather pattern.
If it happens, we won't be able to bear the consequences,"" he warned.","Already reeling under the after-effects of tormenting heatwaves, India cannot afford to have a poor monsoon which could spell disaster for its agriculture-based economy , experts have said, hoping a revival of monsoon rains will ease food inflation and ensure food security.The monsoon accounts for around 70 per cent of the country's annual rainfall and irrigates 60 per cent of its net sown area. Nearly half of the population depends on agriculture directly or indirectly.A bad monsoon invariably means bad crop production and inflation.An early onslaught of heatwaves has already impacted rabi crops, prompting the government to curb wheat exports and cut output predictions by roughly 5 per cent — from 111.3 million tonnes to 106.4 million tonnes.Another disruption in the weather pattern can have serious consequences in terms of the country's food security.While the MeT office has predicted a normal monsoon for the fourth year on the trot, its slow progress in the first half of June sparked fears about a delay in the sowing of crops such as paddy.However, the weather department says it is expected to pick up pace and compensate for any deficiency.The prediction is good and the rainfall is picking up. The countrywide rainfall deficit has decreased from 43 per cent on June 11 to 18 per cent on June 17, said Mrutyunjay Mohapatra, Director General (D-G), India Meteorological Department (IMD).“Normal rainfall activity will continue in peninsular India, east and central parts of the country and the Northeast,” he said, adding that the precipitation in northwest India will increase after June 23.Mohapatra said monsoon never leads to an even rainfall distribution across all regions.“If we look at spatial distribution, some areas will get less rainfall; some will get more. The quantum will be normal and that is what we have predicted,” the IMD D-G said.He said La Nina conditions, considered good for the monsoon, will continue till the end of the season, but will be countered by the projected negative Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), known for obstructing the progression of the monsoon over India.“The net result will be a normal monsoon,” the meteorologist added.G P Sharma, president (meteorology), Skymet Weather, said it looked like the monsoon had hit a roadblock as it entered the third week.The country received deficient rainfall as far as the agriculture sector is concerned, he said, attributing the sluggish start to the absence of a ""driving system like offshore trough, cyclonic circulation, among others"".But that is going to change soon. A cyclonic circulation will come up over parts of West Bengal, north Odisha and adjoining Bangladesh in three to four days which will change the wind pattern in the Indo-Gangetic plains, the meteorologist said on Friday.""This cyclonic circulation will initiate the typical easterly flow which is crucial for the advance of the monsoon into northwest India,"" he said.Central parts of the country, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, adjoining Telangana, Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand, are the core monsoon rain-fed area and therefore, are the most vulnerable.“Farmers in Punjab and Haryana do not depend on monsoon. They have their resources and irrigation network -- tube wells, canals, among others. Whereas central India eagerly waits for monsoon rains,” he said.A delay in the monsoon poses a greater risk to Maharashtra, as it is a large state stretching from the Konkan coast to Vidarbha and has diverse weather conditions.“But the situation is becoming better. The disappointing phase has ended at least for the month of June. The rain-fed areas are expected to do well,” Sharma said.Principal Scientist and Professor, Indian Agricultural Research Institute (IARI), Vinod Sehgal said rainfall deficit will be compensated by the end of June.“The outlook is good and it appears to be reviving. We should get good rains in July. The situation is not so concerning. A large rainfall deficit that extends into the first week of July is considered disastrous for the Kharif crop,” he said.A good rainfall is all the more necessary because the prolonged heatwaves have sucked the moisture from the soil, the scientist said.Sehgal attributed the food inflation to heatwaves and volatile global markets.Globally, the demand for wheat grew due to the Russia-Ukraine war. The two nations together export a quarter of the world's wheat.The increase in crude oil prices and the weakening of Rupee also leads to diversion of a substantial amount of foodgrain for the production of bio-ethanol which in turn leads to food inflation, the IARI professor explained.Food and trade policy expert Devinder Sharma said deadly heat waves have already hit the wheat yields this year and the country needs a normal monsoon for adequate rice production.Punjab has 98 per cent of its crop area under assured irrigation. But not all regions of the country have this advantage, he said.The monsoon has been sluggish in the first part of June, with the rainfall deficit piling up to 80 per cent in some parts of the country. It will certainly impact the yield, Sharma said.“Reports suggest that the second half of the monsoon will be volatile. Some reports say the rainfall deficit will continue over the next two months. It does not paint a very good picture.""If the rainfall deficit continues into the second and third week of July, it will have serious ramifications.

We are on a mission to make people climate smart and enable them to handle the vagaries of climate change better,” he says.
We are trying to demonstrate that using smart and sustainable solar-based solutions for irrigation and cold storage will help improve livelihoods in Africa,” he says.","Pune-based Ecozen, a climate-smart deep tech startup, announced earlier this month that it had raised Rs 54 crore and is in talks for the remaining amount of its planned Rs 200 crore funding. Founded by IIT Kharagpur alumni Devendra Gupta, Prateek Singhal and Vivek Pandey, Ecozen’s technologies are deployed in the agricultural sector for irrigation and cooling. The products are solar pump controllers called Ecotron, which occupy almost 20 per cent of the Indian market, and solar cold storage rooms called Ecofrost, which make up 50 per cent.

“For farmers, who do not have access to power, we provide the Ecotron, which uses a controller and motor that belongs to us, to do more production. Currently, a lot of farmers are dependent on grid-connected electrical and diesel pump sets, among others. We help them to reduce the cost of diesel and increase their yields. Because of efficient irrigation, they can get to three or four harvests,” says Gupta in a telephonic interview. The cold storage room enables farmers to keep their commodities fresh for longer as they determine where and to whom they want to sell their produce to.

As the Indian market grows, Ecozen estimates that their business will scale more than twice from last year. “The investment we have raised will enable us to increase our capacity and features to deliver on the domestic demand, even as we try to enter other markets in Africa and south east Asia. We are also trying to build a team to look after exports,” says Gupta. In a major shift, the company is exploring the use of their core technology in areas outside agriculture, such as electric vehicles. “A part of the capital we have raised will go to build innovative products for these sectors,” says Gupta.

A National Innovations in Climate Resilient Agriculture project of 2019, which studied the effect of climate change on agriculture, found that yields of crops such as rice, wheat and maize were particularly vulnerable. Ecozen’s answer to unseasonal rains and groundwater depletion is to bring in controls and methods to conserve water, “where a farmer is able to schedule and manage it better”. “They can use powered irrigation to do their farming and save their harvest. Through these mechanisms, we are trying to help farmers manage climate change a bit better,” he says.

Ecozen is present in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Haryana, Odisha and Jharkhand and is targeting UP, Rajasthan, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and the southern belt. “The products are capital intensive so we are targeting progressive customers across India. We are on a mission to make people climate smart and enable them to handle the vagaries of climate change better,” he says.

Kenya, where the company is conducting pilot projects, presents an acute new challenge. “The penetration of irrigation is less than 15 per cent there. The infrastructure, including roads, and logistics are not very good. Commodity prices are very high. We feel that the economic solutions that our technology can deliver in Africa are quite high. We are trying to demonstrate that using smart and sustainable solar-based solutions for irrigation and cold storage will help improve livelihoods in Africa,” he says.

The world is experiencing its hottest summer, which makes interventions from governments, organisations, individuals and companies all the more acute. “I am hopeful that, while things are moving south, we have people trying to figure out ways to bring it under control. But, while this happens, there will be difficulties and challenges and technologies will be important in moving forward,” says Gupta.",https://images.indianexpress.com/2022/06/Ecozen-Facility-min.jpg,[],https://indianexpress.com/article/cities/pune/pune-inc-a-startup-on-a-mission-to-make-people-climate-smart-7995276/

Below are some of the steps forward at this year’s COP27 summit concluded at the weekend in Egypt:

The Shape Of Carbon Markets

Countries have been negotiating how to make international trading in carbon offsets work since the 2015 Paris Agreement, and the launch of the system is likely to be several years off as the debate continues into 2023.

Offsets allow countries or companies to pay others to cut greenhouse gas emissions to make up for their own.

By the end of the first week of COP27, officials had agreed to put off decisions on which projects – from wind farms to tree planting – should be eligble to generate carbon offset credits.

In the second week, countries made progress on setting out how country-to-country trading would work as well as clarifying some aspects of how countries could authorise a project within their borders to sell credits abroad, Laura Albuquerque, a senior manager at consultancy WayCarbon, said.

Negotiators also finalised most of the guidelines for how carbon credits under an old offset trading system could be brought in line with the new rules, she said.

But many decisions were pushed to next year or later, including whether avoided emissions from deforestation or other sources should qualify for carbon credits.

“The texts provide key elements to implement high-integrity carbon markets that can help deliver net-zero ambitions for all countries,” said Dirk Forrister, chief executive of the International Emissions Trading Association.

“We expect further decisions at COP28 and beyond.”

‘Too Little, Too Late’ On Adaptation

Developing countries hit by climate impacts say the annual U.N. climate negotiations focus too much on measures to cut emissions, and not enough on adaptation to the consequences of global warming, such as sea level rise.

At last year’s COP26 U.N. summit, countries agreed to double the amount of adaptation financing by $40 billion by 2025. While the world is falling short of that goal, few expected the issue to be advanced this year in Egypt.

“‘Too little, too late’ is what developing countries are arguing,” as climate change is already exacerbating flood events, drought and sea level rise, Maarten Van Aalst, director of the Red Cross Red Crescent Climate Center, said.

Some progress was made toward defining a “global goal on adaptation,” which in addition to finance would likely include a wider array of tools and cooperation platforms to help countries to adapt. That could include humanitarian relief, the transfer of technology and early warning systems for climate disasters.

Rather than reaching a final decision, countries this year adopted a framework that laid out the questions that need answers to define that goal at a future COP.

Van Aalst called the framework “a pretty technical step forward” and a “helpful piece of progress.”

Agriculture And Food Late-Comers To The Debate

Food is responsible for one-third of global greenhouse gas emissions.

But discussions on how to curb those emissions are relatively new within U.N. climate negotiations.

Adopted in 2017, the Koronivia Joint Work on Agriculture (KJWA) has held workshops to address climate-related agricultural issues including best practices in livestock, soil management, and water use. The work also deals with food security and the economic impacts of global warming.

As the initial mandate expired, countries at COP27 authorised the KJWA work to continue for another four years.

Countries need to decide how to move from talking in workshops to pushing for measures to be implemented in practice, for example, in ways to help governments meet national emissions-cutting targets, said Bernadette Fischler, head of advocacy at World Wildlife Fund (WWF) UK.

More than 100 organisations including WWF and the Environmental Defense Fund signed a letter urging COP27 negotiators to expand the scope of Koronivia to include consumption and waste, but Egypt talks kept the narrow focus on agriculture.

Fishler said the emissions from the overall food system need to be reduced if the world is to succeed limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial temperatures, the level beyond which scientists say the impact of climate change will become far more devastating.

“You can just phase out fossil fuels, you can’t phase out food,” she said.

NDTV – Dettol have been working towards a clean and healthy India since 2014 via the Banega Swachh India initiative, which is helmed by Campaign Ambassador Amitabh Bachchan. The campaign aims to highlight the inter-dependency of humans and the environment, and of humans on one another with the focus on One Health, One Planet, One Future – Leaving No One Behind. It stresses on the need to take care of, and consider, everyone’s health in India – especially vulnerable communities – the LGBTQ population, indigenous people, India’s different tribes, ethnic and linguistic minorities, people with disabilities, migrants, geographically remote populations, gender and sexual minorities. In wake of the current COVID-19 pandemic, the need for WASH (Water, Sanitation and Hygiene) is reaffirmed as handwashing is one of the ways to prevent Coronavirus infection and other diseases. The campaign will continue to raise awareness on the same along with focussing on the importance of nutrition and healthcare for women and children, fight malnutrition, mental wellbeing, self care, science and health, adolescent health & gender awareness. Along with the health of people, the campaign has realised the need to also take care of the health of the eco-system. Our environment is fragile due to human activity, which is not only over-exploiting available resources, but also generating immense pollution as a result of using and extracting those resources. The imbalance has also led to immense biodiversity loss that has caused one of the biggest threats to human survival – climate change.
